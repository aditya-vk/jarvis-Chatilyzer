[1/17/17, 7:20:03 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I'd say that's more MR than VR than AR
[1/17/17, 7:20:29 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: What's MR?
[1/17/17, 7:20:52 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Mixed
[1/17/17, 7:21:03 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: What does that mean?
[1/17/17, 7:21:06 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Mix of?

[1/17/17, 7:21:13 PM] Maitreya Naik: That's weird af
[1/17/17, 7:21:32 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It's MR to us, it was VR to him

[1/17/17, 7:21:36 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Haha why?
[1/17/17, 7:21:59 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: But isn't the camera just the way to capture it and show us?
[1/17/17, 7:22:27 PM] Maitreya Naik: I understand the addiction and crashing part. But in a very twitchy, maybe contemporary way
[1/17/17, 7:22:33 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Yeah
[1/17/17, 7:22:51 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I'd  like to see Akanksha dance and do something like this :D

[1/17/17, 7:23:22 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Me? Before Nupur?
[1/17/17, 7:24:18 PM] Maitreya Naik: Ya. But the interaction of reality with virtual environments and vice versa is mixed reality.
It's a mix of augmented reality and augmented virtuality
[1/17/17, 7:24:26 PM] Maitreya Naik: Augmented reality affects us
[1/17/17, 7:24:43 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: This affects us too

[1/17/17, 7:25:15 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I see
[1/17/17, 7:25:28 PM] Koushik Bhavani: Vote me 😂
[1/17/17, 7:25:29 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I'll try and unravel the differences in a bit :P
[1/17/17, 7:25:30 PM] Maitreya Naik: Wait. No.
The mixed reality is the guy painting and the paints affecting his movement
[1/17/17, 7:25:43 PM] Maitreya Naik: You aren't involved as a viewer
[1/17/17, 7:25:54 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Haha okay

[1/17/17, 7:26:42 PM] Maitreya Naik: Oh no. I am explaining it.
[1/17/17, 7:26:51 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I'm interested
[1/17/17, 7:27:02 PM] Maitreya Naik: The "wait. No." Was for her claim of being affected
[1/17/17, 7:27:25 PM] Maitreya Naik: Ya. It's really like a typical problem/ovcurence
[1/17/17, 7:27:32 PM] Maitreya Naik: *occurence
[1/17/17, 7:27:59 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Also for my IoT course we need to find some interesting IoT products. What have you people come across?

[1/20/17, 5:50:24 PM] Prithvi Shankar: Sure. Why not?
[1/20/17, 5:53:33 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: There was a Bus Conductor, who was Very Rude to his passengers.

One day, a Beautiful Young Girl, of around 18 Years, tried to board the bus, but he didn't stop the bus.

Unfortunately, the beautiful young girl came under the bus and died on the spot.

Angry passengers took the conductor to the police station, who in turn took him to the court.

The Judge was not at all impressed with him and gave him capital punishment.

He was taken to the electrocution chamber. There was a single chair in the center of the room. The conductor was strapped to the chair and high voltage current was given to him. But, to everyone's amazement, he survived. The judge decided to set him free, and he returned to his profession.
.
.
.

A couple of months later, an elderly gentleman tried to board the bus.

This time the Bus conductor, remembering his earlier experience stopped the bus. Unfortunately, the elderly gentleman slipped and died due to his injuries. 

The conductor was taken to the police station and then to the court, to the same judge. 

Though, he hadn't done anything wrong, but considering his past record the judge decided to set an example and gave him capital punishment.

The Bus conductor was again taken to the same electrocution chamber where there was a single chair in the center of the room. He was strapped to the chair and high voltage current was given to him.

This time he died instantly.....!!!!!
.
.

The question is why didn't he die on the first occasion..?? but, died instantly the second time....??
.
.
.
.
.
.

Okay........ here is the Answer............

During the first time The Conductor was a Bad Conductor, therefore electricity didn't pass through him. But, during the second time, he was a Good Conductor, so electricity passed through him freely and he died !!!! Physics never go wrong....

[1/20/17, 11:05:37 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Ah ok
[1/20/17, 11:05:40 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-women-asia-idUSKBN155039?utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&utm_content=5883082104d3016fb61af62c&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=facebook
[1/20/17, 11:05:42 PM] Koushik Bhavani: Nice
[1/20/17, 11:05:51 PM] Koushik Bhavani: So you'll be attending this?
[1/20/17, 11:05:53 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: They've happening all over the country and the world too, apparently
[1/20/17, 11:06:02 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Yeah but I have to wake up :P
[1/20/17, 11:06:33 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: It's starting at 11
[1/20/17, 11:07:14 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: What I'm really surprised at is that there were so many women who voted in support of trump
[1/20/17, 11:07:15 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: My friends have gone to DC for this
[1/20/17, 11:08:38 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Ohh nice
[1/20/17, 11:08:46 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Yeah one of mine has gone too
[1/20/17, 11:09:47 PM] Koushik Bhavani: Ya y suddenly when voting happened and he won this wasn't there no?
[1/20/17, 11:09:55 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Well it was
[1/20/17, 11:10:17 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: There was a march then as well
[1/20/17, 11:10:21 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I went for that one
[1/20/17, 11:10:43 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Right now because his inauguration just happened
[1/20/17, 11:10:56 PM] Koushik Bhavani: Ya that's correct
[1/20/17, 11:11:06 PM] Koushik Bhavani: But will all this help ?
[1/20/17, 11:11:10 PM] Maitreya Naik: Ellsworth was crazy on election day
[1/20/17, 11:11:31 PM] Maitreya Naik: It's a matter of making a statement
[1/20/17, 11:11:31 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I was wondering about that myself
[1/20/17, 11:11:53 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I think it helps marginalised people because they often feel alone
[1/20/17, 11:12:07 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: this helps then see that there are people behind them
[1/20/17, 11:12:24 PM] Koushik Bhavani: Hmm ya maybe in that perspective it does help
[1/20/17, 11:12:31 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: It sends a message to Trump and his cabinet
[1/20/17, 11:12:34 PM] Maitreya Naik: People feel encouraged. The news of the march itself awakens feelings either positive or negative in a majority of people
[1/20/17, 11:12:46 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: because there are many elections, not just the presidential one
[1/20/17, 11:12:55 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Like governors, senators, etc
[1/20/17, 11:13:16 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Those will be coming up soon and this might help to show that they should take these people seriously
[1/20/17, 11:13:36 PM] Maitreya Naik: And even daily lives get affected by laws or no laws when biases are prevalent either based on color, culture, sexual orientation, etc
[1/20/17, 11:14:20 PM] Koushik Bhavani: True it does help then I guess had never seen it that way
[1/20/17, 11:14:38 PM] Maitreya Naik: An organized March across the nation creates a sense of support and motivation for communities who may feel like they are treated unfairly
[1/20/17, 11:15:22 PM] Maitreya Naik: But that too since not many are happening. It's a balance. You can't keep excessively protesting every day for 2 months.
[1/20/17, 11:16:27 PM] Koushik Bhavani: But in Tamil Nadu they kind of protested continuously for days regarding this jalli kattu matter
[1/20/17, 11:16:30 PM] Maitreya Naik: It's like the reservation back in India. Just keeping reservations, after so many years doesn't aid growth of oppressed communities. It could cultivate more negative feelings toward those communities if overdone
[1/20/17, 11:17:04 PM] Koushik Bhavani: Yes agreed
[1/20/17, 11:17:25 PM] Koushik Bhavani: Ok nice politics talk now going to sleep good night people😁
[1/20/17, 11:17:46 PM] Maitreya Naik: Haha. Good night
[1/20/17, 11:17:53 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Haha I should too
[1/20/17, 11:18:28 PM] Maitreya Naik: Ya
 Like most things in life. It depends what you define as "too much". Depending how much the activity would directly affect a matter, how much reach it gets, etc
[1/20/17, 11:18:43 PM] Maitreya Naik: Good night, people
[1/20/17, 11:52:57 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: https://m.facebook.com/madovermarketing/photos/a.276687905730484.66881.275323192533622/1345916575474273/?type=3&source=48

[1/28/17, 4:03:56 PM] Shivam Gupta: Another idea is a smart fridge which suggests a recipe based on ingredients you have

[1/31/17, 8:12:38 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: AVK doesn't make typos :P
[1/31/17, 8:13:35 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: My English level is equivalent to that of fifth graders'. If I make typos in that also..
[1/31/17, 8:21:06 AM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: @14128198111 you also have a class
[1/31/17, 8:21:46 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: give us your ID cards 😋
[1/31/17, 8:26:01 AM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: Yeah, you can do that
[1/31/17, 8:47:28 AM] Prithvi Shankar: I do? 🙈
[1/31/17, 8:46:25 PM] Akanksha Periwal CMU: Hey, if someone applies to the LTI program as well as an MS in Cs, they were be treated as 2 separate applications right ?
I mean, could you get a reject in one and an admit in the other ?
[1/31/17, 8:47:23 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: No and yes
[1/31/17, 8:48:14 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Yes and yes
[1/31/17, 8:48:16 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Within SCS, an admissions committee can see all your SCS applications which shows your explicit preferences / focus
[1/31/17, 8:48:33 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Praks applied to both. She got both.
[1/31/17, 8:48:40 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: You should talk to her
[1/31/17, 8:49:06 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: The admissions committee sees all SoP and all information from any application
[1/31/17, 8:49:26 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: But yes, you might be accepted in both since the committees are held separately
[1/31/17, 8:49:46 PM] Akanksha Periwal CMU: Oh okay.
Thank you :)
[1/31/17, 8:50:26 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Ah I see. Didn't know about this..
[1/31/17, 8:50:46 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Me neither, until recently 😄
[1/31/17, 8:53:57 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: *neither did I*....

[2/3/17, 10:25:34 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: You are smart hat has ha
[2/3/17, 10:25:41 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Haha ha

[2/4/17, 10:32:05 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: <‎image omitted>
[2/4/17, 10:52:53 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: 😂
[2/4/17, 10:58:24 AM] Koushik Bhavani: Lolz
[2/4/17, 11:09:19 AM] Shivam Gupta: 😂😂
[2/4/17, 5:18:26 PM] Koushik Bhavani: anyone wants to go to chipotle for dinner?
[2/4/17, 5:18:56 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: No but I wanna hang out
[2/4/17, 6:09:01 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: What's the scene?
[2/4/17, 6:09:34 PM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: Me Koushik and Prithvi are at Chipotle
[2/4/17, 6:10:13 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: anyone staying late today?
[2/4/17, 6:10:16 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: anyone gym today?
[2/4/17, 6:10:16 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: lol
[2/4/17, 6:14:42 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: 🏊
[2/4/17, 6:15:17 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: You're finally quenching your thirst for Mexican :)
[2/4/17, 6:48:48 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uE7qVAtNwQk&feature=youtu.be
[2/4/17, 6:48:53 PM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: 😍yes
[2/4/17, 6:48:59 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Superbowl sunday
[2/4/17, 7:34:56 PM] Koushik Bhavani: 💃🏻💃🏻
[2/4/17, 9:40:35 PM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: Hey! We are conducting a survey as a part of one our course long projects. Please take a few minutes off to take this short survey.
[2/4/17, 9:40:36 PM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: https://goo.gl/forms/P5l7PIG05iCn1TAE2
[2/4/17, 9:40:49 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: No.
[2/4/17, 9:40:56 PM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: K.
[2/4/17, 9:42:08 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: So ideally I would like to see posters on the bulletin board
[2/4/17, 9:42:30 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: But if it something I would definitely not want to miss, I'd like to see it on the mobile so I can quickly add it to my calendar
[2/4/17, 9:42:38 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Like the everyday seminar talks
[2/4/17, 9:42:48 PM] Prithvi Shankar: Just take the survey.
[2/4/17, 9:42:52 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: It's a pain to take a picture of the poster and then add it to calendar later
[2/4/17, 9:42:58 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I did :P
[2/4/17, 9:43:03 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: And it's  not immediately obvious what you mean by posters
[2/4/17, 9:43:12 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: ^True
[2/4/17, 9:43:15 PM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: Yeah we are adding the add to calendar option
[2/4/17, 9:43:24 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I clicked 0 at first because I thought you meant the scientific poster type things
[2/4/17, 9:44:07 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Are you checking the viability of making a single place where people can see campus and other nearby related information?
[2/4/17, 9:45:15 PM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: We are making a virtual poster app
[2/4/17, 9:45:39 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: So for those events that have posters?
[2/4/17, 9:47:15 PM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: Yeah the posters/fliers could be related to anything, events or available positions in teams or ta/ra etc
[2/4/17, 9:48:43 PM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: Or tryouts etc
[2/4/17, 9:49:49 PM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: And we would be able to view them depending on our location, say you are near the gym, you would be notified about related posters.
[2/4/17, 9:50:01 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Location and not preferences?
[2/4/17, 9:50:10 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Or both?
[2/4/17, 9:50:12 PM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: Both
[2/4/17, 9:50:41 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I worked on what seems like a very similar thing at NITK
[2/4/17, 9:50:55 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Tell me if you want to talk about it at some point :)
[2/4/17, 9:51:30 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Campus connect?
[2/4/17, 9:51:41 PM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: We are planning to ask preference for notifications, but they can still view the other posters by opening the app
[2/4/17, 9:51:44 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Haha yeah doesn't it sound similar?
[2/4/17, 9:54:07 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Kinda
[2/4/17, 9:54:32 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Personally, I hate notifications from random apps
[2/4/17, 9:54:58 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Yeah I know what you mean..notifications can get irritating
[2/4/17, 9:55:09 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I'd prefer something that showed me what I want to see when I want to see it.
[2/4/17, 9:56:20 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: When my phone vibrates, I hope it's from a conversation. So WhatsApp / messenger is preferred. If it's not that, I get annoyed immediately. Even when it is that, sometimes I get annoyed coz it's not from the people I want messaging me :p
[2/4/17, 9:56:22 PM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: Yeah we are planning to keep an option like mute on WhatsApp for this app
[2/4/17, 10:06:27 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Not gonna happen. Don't try to create a thing, you should build on an existing habit. That's where your best chances are.
[2/4/17, 10:07:11 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Do you use the Scs events web site or do you wait for the daily feed bot to tell you what's next?
[2/4/17, 10:08:37 PM] Shivam Gupta: I cannot agree more with this point
[2/4/17, 10:09:07 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: You could build new habits, but do some user research. The survey was a good start
[2/4/17, 10:09:17 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: If you aren't already, do some interviews
[2/4/17, 10:10:58 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: There's a daily feed bot!?
[2/4/17, 10:12:43 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: 😄
[2/4/17, 10:13:22 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: See, laziness is part of human nature. Creating  a habit is super hard. Unless it's superseding another habit or there a huge benefit from it.
[2/4/17, 10:13:44 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Exactly :]
[2/4/17, 10:14:44 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Not there isn't. But what you felt was envy, one of the reasons social apps, games, and network work.
[2/4/17, 10:14:59 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: There are other reasons. You may wanna tap into those.
[2/4/17, 10:15:14 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Nupur, I told you too. Humans are lazy.
[2/4/17, 10:15:47 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It's sad how I know this and still continue to indulge.
[2/4/17, 10:16:19 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Well, maybe whatever social-X that you use provides you with something more
[2/4/17, 10:16:23 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Humans are lazy, isn't that why you'd want an app that could tell you what events are round the corner? Such an app would work
[2/4/17, 10:16:34 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: It's just that you'd need to somehow efficiently filter the crap out
[2/4/17, 10:16:39 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Contacts, more info for less effort, etc.
[2/4/17, 10:16:58 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: That's the hardest part
[2/4/17, 10:17:09 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: What I like today might be irrelevant tomorrow
[2/4/17, 10:17:14 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: How about this
[2/4/17, 10:17:36 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Lets safely assume that we do everything as a group?
[2/4/17, 10:17:48 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: ?
[2/4/17, 10:17:50 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: They're an app called meet-up for that in real life. It's so hard to use that you end up either muting it or using it for a very specific topic
[2/4/17, 10:18:02 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: So you crowd source your posters of interest from what your "favourite" people are gonna attend
[2/4/17, 10:18:17 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Still has to start somewhere, but that could be a good _filter_
[2/4/17, 10:18:30 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Meet-up is much too complex hmm
[2/4/17, 10:18:36 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Too much nonsense
[2/4/17, 10:18:44 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Like on overheard but for posters
[2/4/17, 10:19:03 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Specific formatting so that you reduce cognitive load to its lowest level
[2/4/17, 10:19:39 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: With a specific formatting...
[2/4/17, 10:21:54 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Your very best chance is to promote that you'll have all the free food events on campus
[2/4/17, 10:22:18 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: That you can share in one click to specific groups

For you chat bot people :]
[2/8/17, 10:33:40 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Thanks 😁
[2/8/17, 2:27:59 PM] Maitreya Naik: https://www.facebook.com/events/1322942361106797/?ti=as
[2/8/17, 2:28:03 PM] Maitreya Naik: Go now
[2/8/17, 2:31:50 PM] Prithvi Shankar: Yeah . Gautam's already there
[2/8/17, 2:32:18 PM] Maitreya Naik: Ya. I told him and Poojita when I saw them in person but forgot tell the group
[2/8/17, 2:33:19 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: (sigh)
[2/8/17, 2:33:47 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: It's too much work. You need to go to each restaurant for a small bowl of soup :/
[2/8/17, 2:35:58 PM] Prithvi Shankar: 😂😂😂
[2/8/17, 2:39:37 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: And pay for it?
[2/8/17, 2:39:52 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: No 😅
[2/8/17, 4:44:36 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Have any of you ever worked with quaternions before ?
[2/8/17, 4:44:48 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I need some help.
[2/8/17, 4:46:41 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: 🖕
[2/8/17, 4:46:57 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: By the way I can help. Shoot 😁
[2/8/17, 4:48:49 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Lol. So I'm making an IK solver and it works perfectly, except I want to add constraints now. For instance, I don't want an elbow joint rotating in a way a normal elbow joint wouldn't. How do I do this? I'm using the CCD method to solve the IK.
[2/8/17, 4:49:12 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: And I'm using Quaternions to rotate each joint.
[2/8/17, 4:50:53 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: So you want to set hard-stops over the joint angles? Or is that you want to specify the axis of rotation of the joints?
[2/8/17, 4:51:54 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Axis is found by the IK solver. But I want to set up points where it'll stop rotating.
[2/8/17, 4:52:00 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: A video might explain this better. Wait.
[2/8/17, 4:54:31 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: <‎video omitted>
[2/8/17, 5:00:59 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: <‎video omitted>
[2/8/17, 5:20:34 PM] Maitreya Naik: 6467.pdf • ‎60 pages <‎document omitted>
[2/8/17, 5:20:49 PM] Maitreya Naik: This has sort of an approximate way of looking at things, but may be useful
[2/8/17, 5:22:45 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Haha that was very pleasant to the eyes for some reason :D
[2/8/17, 5:22:52 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: When the elbow went backwards
[2/8/17, 5:23:40 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Some men just want to watch the world turn?
[2/8/17, 5:24:11 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: okay so you set a limit that when you are trying to move the shoulder *more* than the limit it is *equal* to the limit
[2/8/17, 5:24:37 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: yeah, that's essentially what I want to do.
[2/8/17, 5:24:47 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Except I don't know HOW to set the limit in terms of quaternions.
[2/8/17, 5:26:18 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: so in a quaternion you have 4 numbers and they are like this:
[2/8/17, 5:27:17 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: 1. kx(sin(theta/2))
2. ky(sin(theta/2))
3. kz(sin(theta/2))
4. cos(theta/2)
Where (kx,ky,kz) is the axis of rotation and (theta) is the angle of rotation
[2/8/17, 5:27:23 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: So to set the limit you can say
[2/8/17, 5:27:52 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I think you can say
[2/8/17, 5:27:59 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Um
[2/8/17, 5:28:41 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: alright
[2/8/17, 5:28:52 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: when you move the hand the quaternion representation of that joint is changing
[2/8/17, 5:29:00 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: so you can extract the angle out of it
[2/8/17, 5:29:03 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: from 1,2,3,4
[2/8/17, 5:29:21 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: And then say if that angle is greater than threshold, equate it to threshold
[2/8/17, 5:29:27 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: yeah
[2/8/17, 5:30:30 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: something like sqrt(1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2)) would give you sin(theta/2) becasue kx,ky,kz is a unit vector
[2/8/17, 5:30:40 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: but I think you should take care of the signs
[2/8/17, 5:30:47 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: otherwise i think thats the way you'd go
[2/8/17, 5:30:57 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: But how do I specify the thresholds?
[2/8/17, 5:31:04 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: oh wait, that's just an angle.
[2/8/17, 5:31:08 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: But wait.
[2/8/17, 5:32:02 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Argh
[2/8/17, 5:34:13 PM] Maitreya Naik: Okay. Hold up. You're sort of on the right track here
[2/8/17, 5:34:46 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Yeah that's just an angle
[2/8/17, 5:34:49 PM] Maitreya Naik: You get the sin component and the cos component and hence you can do an arctan to get an angle.
The tricky part here is
[2/8/17, 5:34:51 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: But take care of the signs
[2/8/17, 5:34:59 PM] Maitreya Naik: Hold up
[2/8/17, 5:35:00 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: because you are taking a sqrt
[2/8/17, 5:35:34 PM] Maitreya Naik: Yes. The tricky part here is that this can be equivalent to a 180° rotated angle too.
[2/8/17, 5:35:57 PM] Maitreya Naik: This is exactly what is done in the PDF I just shared
[2/8/17, 5:36:27 PM] Maitreya Naik: And instead of doing the arctan mess, they directly used a pictorial representation and a vector approximation on a circle
[2/8/17, 5:36:27 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Okay, if I want to say, that about X axis I want to limit it to (min,max) and same for Y and Z axes, how do I represent these limits in terms of quaternions?
I have a quaternion q which basically gives me the axis and the angle I need to rotate by and I use this to multiply with the current rotation (which is a quaternion) of a joint (for every joint). So I need to check if the product is within the threshold. Correct? And if it is in the threshold, I rotate, otherwise, I go to the one which is the closest. Except, how do I determine that with limits on the 3 axes?
[2/8/17, 5:36:59 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I'm sorry if I'm being really stupid here, I just started to work with Quaternions today.
[2/8/17, 5:37:59 PM] Maitreya Naik: Don't worry. I have been working with them on and off for 2 yrs and I keep getting confused myself.
Because the I hereby problem is that you are talking about Euler angle constraints
[2/8/17, 5:38:08 PM] Maitreya Naik: *the problem here
[2/8/17, 5:38:27 PM] Maitreya Naik: And most skeletal bones and joints are represented by quaternions
[2/8/17, 5:38:30 PM] Maitreya Naik: Why?
[2/8/17, 5:39:04 PM] Maitreya Naik: Because the axis of rotation is basically your extended bone (let's say the femur (I don't remember the bone on the forearm yet :P))
[2/8/17, 5:39:17 PM] Maitreya Naik: Or the axis is perpendicular to that bone
[2/8/17, 5:39:53 PM] Maitreya Naik: Sunil, you'll notice that your elbow actually only has one axis of rotation
[2/8/17, 5:40:08 PM] Maitreya Naik: Which is perpendicular to the forearm
[2/8/17, 5:40:48 PM] Maitreya Naik: Hence, this approximate trick to find out the angle may help you put a constraint only on that angle. Since that angle is rotation about that fixed elbox axis
[2/8/17, 5:41:11 PM] Maitreya Naik: Correct if I have got this understanding wrong
@14129616423 @14129547000
[2/8/17, 5:41:18 PM] Maitreya Naik: *Correct me
[2/8/17, 5:41:47 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: You're forgetting this
[2/8/17, 5:42:21 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: <‎video omitted>
[2/8/17, 5:42:32 PM] Maitreya Naik: That's the shoulder
[2/8/17, 5:42:52 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Ah right. Fuck. Hahahah
[2/8/17, 5:42:58 PM] Maitreya Naik: 😛
[2/8/17, 5:43:03 PM] Maitreya Naik: Understandable
[2/8/17, 5:43:08 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: (fuck anatomy)
[2/8/17, 5:43:10 PM] Maitreya Naik: Gets too confusing often
[2/8/17, 5:43:50 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Well, either way. I'm still a little confused.
[2/8/17, 5:45:18 PM] Maitreya Naik: So as AVK said. The Quaternion has 4 components.
3 components forming a vector defining (the axis of rotation)*(sine of angle of rotation)
1 scalar component which is the cosine of the angle of rotation
[2/8/17, 5:47:07 PM] Maitreya Naik: And usually the axis of rotation is a unit vector.
A unit quaternion is basically Euler Norm = 1
Ie
(Kx^2 + Ky^2 + Kz^2)sin^2 + cos^2 = 1
Which would be possible if 
Kx^2 + Ky^2 + Kz^2
[2/8/17, 5:47:16 PM] Maitreya Naik: Kx^2 + Ky^2 + Kz^2=1
[2/8/17, 5:49:52 PM] Maitreya Naik: Sorry. Mistake
[2/8/17, 5:50:06 PM] Maitreya Naik: The sine and cosine of *HALF* the angle of rotation
[2/8/17, 5:52:37 PM] Maitreya Naik: Now. What you want is a lock on this angle of rotation when your elbow is already at a certain angle. Correct?
[2/8/17, 5:54:39 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: yup. Except, I don't know how to check if it is at that angle (yet) and I don't know how to specify that angle and axis. I understand how the quaternion gives me the axis and the angle, but I'm having trouble translating that into my code. I'll try some stuff and then get back, probably with a ton of more doubts.
[2/8/17, 5:55:07 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Thanks guys.
[2/8/17, 5:56:39 PM] Maitreya Naik: 😅 Seems we may have not understood what data you can access and what data you can write. But hope that the quaternion logic in the sense of just defining rotations from your current state rather than an absolute state has become clear
[2/8/17, 5:57:06 PM] Maitreya Naik: Don't hesitate to call me up. I'm pretty interested in humanoids and game development
[2/8/17, 5:57:34 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Yeah I'll hit you up if I have more trouble. Thanks again!
[2/8/17, 6:07:36 PM] Maitreya Naik: Sidebar
If your quaternion has attributes as 
x, y, z, w
Then you don't need all the math
[2/8/17, 6:08:05 PM] Maitreya Naik: (x, y, z) is the axis of rotation
w is the angle of rotation
[2/8/17, 6:20:53 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Lol. Unity handles all the quaternion math for me. I don't even see one of the x,y,z or w components. It's all under the hood.
[2/8/17, 6:21:18 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: You should see the documentation for Quaternions in unity. It's so condescending.
[2/8/17, 6:22:14 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: <‎image omitted>
[2/8/17, 6:22:47 PM] Maitreya Naik: Lol. This is normal
[2/8/17, 6:22:49 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: And I can't do anything with the quaternion I obtain. That's for a specific case. I want to have a general restriction that goes beyond that case.
[2/8/17, 6:23:03 PM] Maitreya Naik: Oh.
[2/8/17, 6:24:57 PM] Maitreya Naik: It seems they are interdependent
[2/8/17, 6:25:08 PM] Maitreya Naik: Ignore this then
[2/8/17, 6:26:08 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: And the problem is compounded coz the joint moves in space also. So I need to check using a local axis rather than a global one. Which is why I'm scratching my head so much.
[2/8/17, 6:26:08 PM] Maitreya Naik: Remember this.
1 is x
2 is y
3 is z
4 is w
[2/8/17, 6:26:26 PM] Maitreya Naik: Ya. That's an issue
[2/8/17, 6:26:42 PM] Maitreya Naik: It seems the quaternion is rotation from the joint's rest position
[2/8/17, 6:27:20 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: It doesn't matter where the joint is in space. All the quaternions would be with respect to local coordinate frame I am sure.
[2/8/17, 6:27:48 PM] Maitreya Naik: Nah. I browsed a few game engine docs.
All of them state from rest position
[2/8/17, 6:28:12 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Rest = angle 0 I guess not the position in space
[2/8/17, 6:28:18 PM] Maitreya Naik: And you can use a temp local rotation quaternion to get a total final Quaternion
[2/8/17, 6:28:31 PM] Maitreya Naik: Hmm. That's true too
[2/8/17, 6:28:41 PM] Maitreya Naik: Translation may be disregarded
[2/8/17, 6:29:03 PM] Maitreya Naik: So would rotation in the global world.
Makes sense
[2/8/17, 6:29:43 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Like I said. I think I'll do some stuff and get my hands dirty with Quaternions first and then ask you questions. Coz I obviously still have a lot left to understand.
[2/8/17, 6:30:11 PM] Maitreya Naik: 👍🏼👍🏼
[2/8/17, 6:30:23 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Cool :)

[2/27/17, 4:03:38 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I use it to express things which I am feeling in the moment, but we could use it in different ways also

[3/17/17, 9:43:56 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: It's pretty good but you should go tipsy
[3/17/17, 9:44:07 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Slightly tipsy
[3/17/17, 9:44:13 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Ergo I should not go
[3/17/17, 9:44:21 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Gotcha
[3/17/17, 9:44:40 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Two scantily clad girls dance on the stage
[3/17/17, 9:44:45 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: You can copy their steps
[3/17/17, 9:44:50 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: If you don't know how to dance
[3/17/17, 9:44:58 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: You'll have fun
[3/17/17, 9:45:04 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It's funny how every new thing you say is making me not wanna go there more
[3/17/17, 9:45:15 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: 😂
[3/17/17, 9:45:20 PM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: @14129616423 are you coming? :P
[3/17/17, 9:45:51 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I haven't made any plans yet, don't know 😅
[3/17/17, 9:45:52 PM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: But it has good music and dance and ambience! So you guys should come!!
[3/17/17, 9:46:18 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Yeah if you go as a group of friends you'll have very good fun 😁
[3/17/17, 9:46:50 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I'm not coming.
[3/17/17, 9:46:56 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: You guys have fun
[3/17/17, 9:47:00 PM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: And we'll predrink as drinks will be expensive there!
[3/17/17, 10:06:07 PM] Shivam Gupta: I'm in for predrink 😜👻
[3/17/17, 10:20:10 PM] Koushik Bhavani: Liez
[3/17/17, 11:42:04 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: People, help. 
Given a set of points, and assuming they form a mesh (which is just visual, there's actually nothing in between these points), how do we make sure that any point doesn't go through this mesh at any time? 
Or rather, how do we check if a point has violated this?
[3/17/17, 11:42:39 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I keep thinking I have to use the normals in some way but I'm not able to think of a way right now.
[3/18/17, 1:18:09 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Given a new point you want to know if it goes through the mesh defined by old points. Is that what you want..?
[3/18/17, 1:20:49 AM] Maitreya Naik: By "going through the mesh", do you mean that they shouldn't lie inside the volume, that they should only occupy the surface of the mesh? Or do you mean that they shouldn't lie on existing edges, essentially meaning that no 3 points should be collinear?
[3/18/17, 1:35:09 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: You can check for convex hull algorithms
[3/18/17, 1:35:17 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: I think it's what you're looking for
[3/18/17, 8:03:36 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Yes, but the issue is that the mesh is constantly changing. And this new point is also part of the mesh only. I wanna check if it's going through another part of the mesh. Basically, I wanna see if it folds and then pushes through another part of the mesh. Getting what I'm saying?
[3/18/17, 8:04:16 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: The mesh doesn't have a volume, it's just a surface mesh.
[3/18/17, 8:04:38 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I think this is probably what I'm looking for, lemme Google it.
[3/18/17, 8:21:00 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Actually convex hull is I think how Unity solves this problem too. But the issue is, mesh colliders (unity's solution) work only when you have less than 256 vertices. I have 400
[3/18/17, 8:25:56 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: Why, tho?
[3/18/17, 8:26:30 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Why what? The restriction? Unity places it. I have no control over that.
[3/18/17, 8:27:25 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: Cut your meshes in overlapping submeshes and run it multiple times
[3/18/17, 8:27:41 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: That'll make it super costly right? :P
[3/18/17, 8:27:55 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: Why? You still have to do it anyway
[3/18/17, 8:28:19 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: You have two 400-vertex meshes?
[3/18/17, 8:28:25 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Just one.
[3/18/17, 8:28:34 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I'm checking for self collision
[3/18/17, 8:28:44 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: Yeah against...
[3/18/17, 8:28:46 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: It self?
[3/18/17, 8:28:49 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Yup
[3/18/17, 8:28:49 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: Another mesh?
[3/18/17, 8:28:54 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Itself
[3/18/17, 8:28:56 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: Ok
[3/18/17, 8:29:12 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: Split it in half and run it three times
[3/18/17, 8:29:37 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Okay I'll try that and another idea I have.
[3/18/17, 8:29:39 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: It's costlier but..
[3/18/17, 8:30:00 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Yeah but it'll work
[3/18/17, 8:30:40 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: Do you want to check for collision in general or at some specific point?
[3/18/17, 8:30:52 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: In general.
[3/18/17, 8:30:58 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Specific point is way too easy
[3/18/17, 8:31:05 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: Ok, then yeah three runs
[3/18/17, 8:31:14 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Cool
[3/18/17, 8:40:23 AM] Koushik Bhavani: Mai I like ur responses in the google form😂

[3/20/17, 1:02:12 PM] Prithvi Shankar: What a guy!! Koushik 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
[3/20/17, 1:02:35 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Thanks Koushik! For doing all the work :P
[3/20/17, 1:02:46 PM] Koushik Bhavani: 😐😐
[3/20/17, 1:03:05 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: You the man.
[3/20/17, 1:07:39 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: ?
[3/20/17, 1:26:04 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: This one is the coolest. AVK looks badass in this.
[3/20/17, 1:30:14 PM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/yourstory.com/2017/03/hipbar-startup/amp/

Their app, HipBar, allows liquor connoisseurs to buy full bottles of their favourite booze and later redeem it in any restaurant or hotel across the country. For example, if the connoisseur buys a bottle of expensive whisky for Rs 5,000, he can consume even a small portion of, say, 30 ml in any bar. The hotel or bar will then charge the connoisseur for the portion, which will be paid through the app. The app will immediately reflect a reduction in the volume of the bottle. The bottle of whisky that was purchased will stand as a prepaid instrument and its value will diminish as the customer opts to consume the whisky later on."

This is so cool
[3/20/17, 1:37:44 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Whoa that's such a good idea
[3/20/17, 1:39:21 PM] Shivam Gupta: Superb idea!
[3/20/17, 1:42:03 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: 👌🏽
[3/20/17, 5:25:27 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Dinner anyone?
[3/20/17, 5:25:35 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I am heading to El Gallo

[3/20/17, 5:39:18 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Just something interesting with a $500 equivalent prize
[3/20/17, 5:40:15 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Had lunch there :)
[3/20/17, 8:19:30 PM] Aum Jadhav: Anyone for Spotify premium family plan? 14.99 for 6 people. We already have 3.
[3/20/17, 8:22:33 PM] Prithvi Shankar: Nupur srijana gautam sanjay Koushik and I are already in similar plans 😅
[3/20/17, 8:23:03 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: How does spotify work?
[3/20/17, 8:23:15 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Can I use somebody else's account?
[3/20/17, 8:23:22 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Like say, obviously, Koushik's?
[3/20/17, 8:23:42 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Only one device at a time. 😋
[3/20/17, 8:23:53 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: You can bully Koushik out of using his
[3/20/17, 8:36:06 PM] Koushik Bhavani: Haha definitely with me having more muscles 😛
[3/20/17, 8:36:22 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: ...
[3/20/17, 8:36:42 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: One muscle to rule them all. No? Too much? Okay. :|
[3/20/17, 8:37:29 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I'll ask nicely, he won't say no :D
[3/20/17, 8:45:23 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Good god. Do you guys hear yourselves?
[3/20/17, 8:45:40 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Old married couple
[3/20/17, 9:27:06 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: <‎image omitted>
[3/21/17, 9:46:14 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: So I was thinking about it again
[3/21/17, 9:46:19 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: The HipBar
[3/21/17, 9:46:37 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: What advantage do you get over just buying the drink in the bar?
[3/21/17, 9:46:49 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Consistent cost?
[3/21/17, 9:47:01 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Cheaper if over the app is not that big a game changer
[3/21/17, 9:47:09 AM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: A bottle is always cheaper than individual shots at restaurants
[3/21/17, 9:47:15 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I see
[3/21/17, 9:47:20 AM] Shruti Rijhwani: Buying a bottle is much much cheaper than shots
[3/21/17, 9:47:29 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Gotcha
[3/21/17, 9:47:37 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: That's neat 😮
[3/21/17, 9:47:39 AM] Shruti Rijhwani: Like 10x
[3/21/17, 9:47:49 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Big incentive wow
[3/21/17, 9:47:51 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Fuck
[3/21/17, 9:47:51 AM] Shruti Rijhwani: I don't how how they would get restaurants to agree to this
[3/21/17, 9:47:57 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Why didn't we think of this
[3/21/17, 9:48:00 AM] Shruti Rijhwani: Because restaurants make so much money from shots
[3/21/17, 9:48:47 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Just have to find the sweet spot where you rise your sales enough to get the profits over those shots that you might miss selling..If you are the restaurant
[3/21/17, 9:48:56 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Cool idea
[3/21/17, 9:49:58 AM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: But the restaurants are going to be paid the same amount for their shot by the company
[3/21/17, 9:50:03 AM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: So they won't care
[3/21/17, 9:50:24 AM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: It's like food panda, we get discounts but the restaurants are paid that much only for the food
[3/21/17, 9:50:28 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: So where does the company make money from?
[3/21/17, 9:50:35 AM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: Don't know😅😅
[3/21/17, 9:50:38 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Especially if it's like 10x
[3/21/17, 9:50:40 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Mmmm
[3/21/17, 9:51:09 AM] Shruti Rijhwani: Yeah exactly
[3/21/17, 9:51:59 AM] Shruti Rijhwani: Maybe they have investors?
[3/21/17, 9:52:01 AM] Shruti Rijhwani: Ads?
[3/21/17, 9:55:00 AM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: Yeah I think ads
[3/21/17, 9:55:56 AM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: Also maybe restaurants have to pay them some money if they want to be included in the app? Because the app is publicizing the restaurants
[3/21/17, 9:55:58 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Or maybe they're just launderin money
[3/21/17, 9:56:08 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: laundering*
[3/21/17, 9:56:09 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Ni
[3/21/17, 9:56:11 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: No
[3/21/17, 9:56:17 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: They get money from the companies
[3/21/17, 9:56:24 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: That sell alcohol!
[3/21/17, 9:57:14 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Right?
[3/21/17, 9:58:00 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: 1. These companies sell bottles only to restaurants I am guessing
2. More bottles sold now by companies effectively
3. Middle man makes less money now
[3/21/17, 10:00:23 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: 4. It would really be ads now. But still the companies will get more visibility. Booyah. Case closed.
[3/21/17, 10:00:28 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Wouldn't *
[3/21/17, 10:02:50 AM] Shruti Rijhwani: Yes they would. Also the companies don't have to sell at wholesale rates to restaurants any more
[3/21/17, 10:03:04 AM] Shruti Rijhwani: They can sell at a higher price to customers where this app keeps some of it
[3/21/17, 10:18:20 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: We should all watch Monty Python.
[3/21/17, 10:21:23 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Lol. I just saw this on reddit:

[3/21/17, 10:46:19 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Looks white and gold to me
[3/21/17, 10:46:24 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: You?
[3/21/17, 10:47:28 PM] Koushik Bhavani: White and gold to me too
[3/21/17, 10:47:47 PM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: I could see white and gold and then after a while I saw blue and black🙈
[3/21/17, 10:58:48 PM] Maitreya Naik: It's sad how these optical illusions are true. The standard circles, lines, and shadows ones were very informative in the past about how our vision can be fooled. But despite that I was not ready to believe that so many people saw the dress as white and gold. Until I had to revisit the aspects of lighting making the brain to try and connect new dots, the existence of the dots being questionable.
But it's clearly blue and black to a lot of my friends
[3/21/17, 10:59:36 PM] Maitreya Naik: 😂😂
[3/21/17, 11:00:45 PM] Maitreya Naik: 😂😂
[3/21/17, 11:06:34 PM] Maitreya Naik: Also, the problem with the Jastrow Illusion(train tracks) is that our brain tries to connect parallel lines and then tries to compare a perpendicular at the interface with one another (essentially making a parallelogram comparison by aligning one side of 2 parallelograms in continuity), instead of realizing the trapezoid nature of an arc (the two opposite sides of an arc's curve are not equal in length. The outer side is larger).
[3/21/17, 11:09:14 PM] Prithvi Shankar: When you scroll top to bottom you'll see white and gold and when you do the reverse you'll see blue and black
[3/21/17, 11:12:09 PM] Maitreya Naik: The dots and the strawberries are too cool though :D
[3/21/17, 11:14:07 PM] Maitreya Naik: White and gold people. Does that work for you? Makes sense if you go from bottom since it has less light because what seems to be throwing you off is the light at the top.

I only see blue and black while scrolling through any horizontal patch
[3/21/17, 11:15:57 PM] Maitreya Naik: Would be interesting to know if scrolling bottom to top helps .
Try this white-gold people: scroll from the bottom so you only see blue and black. Stay and stare for about 10 seconds then try scrolling up and looking at full picture. Does that make it look blue and black ? If yes, for how long before you start perceiving white and gold again? If no, meh.
[3/21/17, 11:28:26 PM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: I still see white and gold😂
[3/21/17, 11:32:50 PM] Maitreya Naik: Damn it

[3/21/17, 11:40:54 PM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: White and gold🙈
[3/21/17, 11:41:19 PM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: But for a second I saw blue and black😅
[3/21/17, 11:41:50 PM] Maitreya Naik: Awesome. I hope this is helping to understand. Now..
[3/21/17, 11:42:30 PM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: Yeaah the top part kind of forces the golden in your head due to the lighting
[3/21/17, 11:43:16 PM] Maitreya Naik: <‎image omitted>
[3/21/17, 11:45:35 PM] Maitreya Naik: This is the least light smeared but as large as possible region I could extract
[3/21/17, 11:45:54 PM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: I still see white and golden😅
[3/21/17, 11:47:49 PM] Maitreya Naik: Lol. Light. I just get reminded of Now You See Me, Chris Angel when I see these illusions :P I would like to say David Blaine. But he is just a magnificent human being
[3/21/17, 11:55:09 PM] Maitreya Naik: And Ben Franklin or Edgar Allan Poe or someone's "Believe nothing that you hear, and only half of what you see".
And the strawberries remind us "You see the world as you believe", indirectly, "We but mirror the world .... If we could change ourselves, the tendencies in the world would also change" - Mahatma
[3/21/17, 11:56:06 PM] Shivam Gupta: I see white and gold in all zoom levels as well
[3/21/17, 11:56:10 PM] Shivam Gupta: 😅
[3/22/17, 3:18:43 AM] Shruti Rijhwani: I see blue and black anyway, but it's darker when I scroll from the bottom upwards.
[3/22/17, 5:45:29 AM] Maitreya Naik: Ya.
[3/22/17, 5:45:33 AM] Maitreya Naik: Sort of
[3/22/17, 6:42:39 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I can see both. I don't need to scroll  and all
[3/22/17, 6:43:17 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: If I think 'No, this is blue and Black', then I see blue and black. Otherwise I see white and gold.
[3/22/17, 6:55:23 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: I can see shades of gold in the black, and patches of white in the blue
[3/22/17, 6:55:50 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: But at a glance, it's black and blue

[3/24/17, 7:22:26 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: :o
[3/24/17, 7:22:33 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Netflix Original
[3/24/17, 7:22:56 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Yeah!
[3/24/17, 7:23:10 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Kinda looks lame but gotta wait and see :D
[3/24/17, 7:27:36 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It's gonna suck.
[3/24/17, 7:27:41 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: That trailer was horrible.
[3/24/17, 7:28:36 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: My hopes are crushed lol
[3/24/17, 7:50:37 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: They should've got Tom Felton to play the role
[3/24/17, 7:54:09 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: That and they should've just stuck to the actual story lol
[3/24/17, 7:55:55 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Oh, they changed it?
[3/24/17, 7:56:02 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: :/
[3/24/17, 7:56:07 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: That's what it looks like
[3/24/17, 7:56:19 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: The actual story has no need of such crazy VFX
[3/24/17, 7:56:34 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Except for maybe displaying the shinigami who they don't even show in the trailer
[3/24/17, 7:56:47 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Yeah 😂
[3/24/17, 7:56:49 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Plus it's set in the USA lol
[3/24/17, 8:35:39 AM] Maitreya Naik: Not really. Ruins it more I feel
[3/24/17, 8:36:03 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Well, clearly we feel differently.
[3/24/17, 8:36:31 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: All I'm saying is that I don't want another dragon ball evolution
[3/24/17, 8:37:44 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: That ^
[3/24/17, 8:42:00 AM] Maitreya Naik: They will do that with the original story and it will be worse. How bout dat
[3/24/17, 8:42:29 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: You don't like the original story, Mai?
[3/24/17, 8:42:36 AM] Maitreya Naik: Apart from Chichi, it was sort of close to original Dragonball too
[3/24/17, 8:42:49 AM] Maitreya Naik: I love it and they will do a shitty job and ruin it
[3/24/17, 8:43:05 AM] Maitreya Naik: Apart from that company phase
[3/24/17, 8:44:25 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: If you love the original story and script and they don't change that, then the only way they can screw it up is with the direction. And that's independent of the story right?
[3/24/17, 8:44:59 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: If they change the story, there's a good chance they'll screw the script up too
[3/24/17, 8:45:36 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: The premise was the same, but the story was really compressed
[3/24/17, 8:46:00 AM] Maitreya Naik: If they do a good job like Daredevil, it would be fun. Good acting and translation is necessary
[3/24/17, 8:47:45 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Haha, this guy doesn't look like he can act very well, at first impression
[3/24/17, 8:49:06 AM] Maitreya Naik: Time will tell I guess. Liked Ryuk's voice though. Read somewhere that it's Willem Dafoe 😁
[3/24/17, 8:54:31 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It is Willem Dafoe.
[3/24/17, 8:55:02 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: They're gonna do that either way :p
[3/24/17, 3:26:35 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: What is this concepts course?
[3/24/17, 3:26:54 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: In the last three days I've seen so many fb posts bitching about it :p
[3/24/17, 5:43:25 PM] Shrivani CMU: Hey! Does anyone have an electric hot pad?

[3/25/17, 4:42:40 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Now should I walk or take the bus? 🤔
[3/25/17, 4:42:48 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Bus
[3/25/17, 4:43:16 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: There's no bus for 15 minutes :/
[3/25/17, 4:50:22 PM] Maitreya Naik: Damn.
[3/25/17, 4:50:29 PM] Maitreya Naik: It's not a 20min walk is it?
[3/25/17, 4:50:40 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: It is, actually.
[3/25/17, 4:50:47 PM] Maitreya Naik: Damn
[3/25/17, 4:50:59 PM] Maitreya Naik: Then better wait for the bus than waste time AND energy
[3/25/17, 4:51:12 PM] Maitreya Naik: Bus can take you in 5mins?
[3/25/17, 4:51:26 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Thanks for your timely opinions :P
[3/25/17, 4:53:00 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: These buses are so slow... 😪
[3/25/17, 4:53:17 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Koushik, you should give them driving lessons
[3/25/17, 4:54:00 PM] Maitreya Naik: Pfft. Ya. And noone will dare to drive again and then he can drive even faster
[3/25/17, 4:54:08 PM] Maitreya Naik: That's a good plan
[3/25/17, 4:54:09 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: 👌🏽😂
[3/25/17, 4:55:27 PM] Koushik Bhavani: 😬
[3/25/17, 5:03:07 PM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: That's why shift to Oakland

[3/28/17, 7:40:23 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: @14128198111
[3/28/17, 7:41:31 PM] Koushik Bhavani: Dear International Students,
 
The following email contains information about the 2016 tax year.  OIE offers services to help you to understand nonresident tax obligations; since tax forms can be confusing, you should take advantage of the services offered by OIE when they are offered.   OIE does not offer services or software to assist with resident tax returns since that information is readily available from a variety of sources.  For complete details about tax obligations, forms, and services, visit the “News” section of the OIE website.  This email contains only basic information about the services and access instructions for GLACIER Tax Prep, a web-based federal tax form preparation service which is provided to CMU students for free (see item #4 below).  GLACIER Tax Prep is the main tax resource provided by OIE.       
 
NOTE:  ALL students (and dependents) who were in the US during 2016 and are nonresidents for tax purposes have at least one nonresident tax form (IRS Form 8843) to complete and submit by April 18, 2017, even if no income was earned in the US during 2016.  If you arrived in the US in 2017, you do not need to do anything for the 2016 tax year.
 
Tips for a successful tax season:
 
1.      Determine your tax residency—Resident or Nonresident for tax purposes?
Students in F-1 or J-1 student status are generally considered to be nonresidents for tax purposes for the first 5 tax years they are in the US.  That means that most students who entered the US in F-1 or J-1 student status on or after January 1, 2012 and are still in student status are nonresidents for 2016 tax purposes. Students who entered the US in F-1 or J-1 student status prior to 2010 are generally residents for tax purposes.  IRS Publication 519 provides more details about determining tax residency.
 
2.      Determine which forms to file.
--Nonresident for tax purposes in 2016 with no US-source income?
You and your dependents only need to complete and submit IRS Form 8843.  ALL nonresidents for tax purposes file Form 8843.  See #3 below.
 
--Nonresident for tax purposes in 2016 with US-source income (stipend, salary, fellowship, scholarship, investments, etc.?
Complete federal, state and local income tax forms in addition to Form 8843.  See section #4 below.
 
--Resident for tax purposes in 2016?
If you have taxable income, complete federal, state and local income tax forms.  If you do not have taxable income, you do not have a filing obligation.  Links to taxing agencies, where you can find more information about forms and filing resident returns can be found in items #6, 7 and 8 below.
 
3.      Complete and mail Form 8843—Nonresidents with no US-source income
Nonresidents for tax purposes who have NO US-source income only need to file IRS Form 8843.  Students complete the biographic information at the top of the form, Parts I and III on page one and sign and date the form on the 2nd page.  Dependents, regardless of age, must also file Form 8843 and would complete the same sections as the student.  Detailed instructions for completing the 8843 can be found on the IRS website.
 
Print and mail the form to:
 
Department of the Treasury
Internal Revenue Service Center
Austin, TX  73301-0215
 
4.   Nonresidents with US-source income
Use (free) GLACIER Tax Prep Software for Federal Tax Forms
 
If you have US-source income, GLACIER Tax Prep is the most effective way to prepare your nonresident federal tax forms.   For federal tax forms, use this web-based tax preparation service.  (Note, “nonresident” as defined by the IRS is different than the immigration definition of “non-resident.”) 
 
This is a free service for current CMU students and scholars only and the password and access information absolutely may not be shared with others.   There are a limited number of uses available and the software is available on a first-come, first-served basis.   If you have software-related questions use the “help” function within GLACIER Tax Prep.
 
Expect to spend at least 30 minutes, and have your information ready when you begin with GLACIER Tax Prep:
·         current and prior US visit dates
·         entry and exit dates
·         I-20s (for F students) or DS-2019 forms (for J students)
·         I-94 record (www.cbp.gov/i94)
·         Passport
·         All pay documents (1042-S, W-2, 1099, etc.)
 
URL:  www.glaciertax.com/login
Click LOG IN if you have already created an account (NOTE: if you used CINTAX or GLACIER Tax Prep in a previous year, you have already created an account). 
 
Otherwise, click CREATE AN ACCOUNT, on the right side if you have never used GLACIER Tax Prep or CINTAX previously.
 
Access Code:  MTA7CGZPGU (don't enter any spaces!) You will then be prompted to enter your own UserID and Password. Please write them down for future use.
The password cannot be shared with ANY non-CMU person.
 
NOTE:  Nonresidents for tax purposes CANNOT file federal tax forms electronically.  GLACIER Tax Prep will help you prepare the appropriate form which you must then print, sign and mail to the IRS.
 
The software provides access to two video tutorials:  the “2016 GTP Tutorial Video” and “2016 Welcome to the US Tax System Informational Video” which we encourage you to view.
 
5.   Pennsylvania (PA) State Tax Filing
To assist with state tax filing, Carnegie Mellon University has arranged the online tax preparation software tool Sprintax to guide you through the state tax filing process and avoid late filing and/or late payment penalties and fines.
 
Sprintax is an easy-to-use, step-by-step tool that helps international students prepare taxes online. Just follow the simple instructions, answer a few questions, and Sprintax will do the rest. 
 
NOTE: This is not a free service.  You will be responsible for any charges associated with using the Sprintax software for state tax filing but Carnegie Mellon has arranged a $3.00 discount access for you for online state tax preparation using Sprintax.  Simply enter CMU2016S3 in the code box on the ‘Review your order’ page.
 
You may use the link through GLACIER tax prep or you may use the link above—either way, you will need your Federal return and all of your documents in order to enter it into Sprintax or you can upload your 1040NR/EZ into Sprintax by saving it first then uploading.
 
If you do not wish to use Sprintax for your state tax filing, you can visit the PA Department of Revenue website to file your PA tax forms: www.revenue.state.pa.us  
Click on “Forms and Publications”, then “Forms for Individuals”, then “Personal Income Tax”
-          PA-40 – 2016 Pennsylvania Income Tax Return
-          PA-40 – 2016 Pennsylvania Income Tax Return Instructions
You may be able to file PA tax forms online.  Information about PA taxes and online filing can be found on the PA Department of Revenue’s website.
 
7.  Local Tax Filing
Pittsburgh Local Tax forms:  http://www.jordantax.com/Act32/EmployerForms.html
Look for “Allegheny County Central” form 70 if you live in Pittsburgh
 
8. Attend OIE’s General Tax Information Session
Tuesday, March 2nd, 5:00 to 6:00 PM
Cohon University Center, McConomy Auditorium
 
This session will provide general information about nonresident tax issues and the forms international students/scholars must submit to comply with US tax laws and review the 8843 form.
 
9. Refer to Tax Forms and Instructions Online
Visit the websites to download forms and instructions, as follows.
 
US Federal Tax forms
 
PA State Tax forms 
 
Local Tax forms
 
If you resided outside of Pennsylvania in 2016—seek additional information
If you have earned income, you may have to file local and/or state income tax returns for the location(s) where you resided/worked.  You can find links to other states’ Department of Revenue to determine filing requirements/forms at: http://www.taxadmin.org/state-tax-forms.  For local tax requirements, check the municipality where you lived/worked.  Sprintax is a great resource for all state tax filing.
 
You may also have to file an Earned Income Tax form for Pittsburgh/Allegheny county if you worked here in addition to working outside of PA.  Check with the city government/revenue or finance office to be sure or if you have questions.
 
General questions may be directed to oie@andrew.cmu.edu, but before emailing OIE, use one of the resources listed above or on the OIE website.
 
9.  Keep a copy of your return and any tax forms you submit!
 
Good luck with your tax forms for 2016!
 
Sincerely,
OIE Staff

[3/29/17, 5:37:34 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: "A person who can debug a device driver or a distributed system is a person who can be trusted in a Hobbesian nightmare of breathtaking scope; a systems programmer has seen the terrors of the world and understood the intrinsic horror of existence. The systems programmer has written drivers for buggy devices whose firmware was implemented by a drunken child or a sober goldfish.”

[3/31/17, 8:49:10 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Liverpool *
[3/31/17, 8:49:11 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: With Arsenal-type fans :P
[3/31/17, 8:49:21 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Whatever makes you sleep bro
[3/31/17, 8:49:33 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Sunil, you do support Arsenal in the EPL right?
[3/31/17, 8:49:40 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Yeah. He does

[3/31/17, 8:51:55 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: It's a Friends reference, never mind :P
[3/31/17, 8:52:40 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: From here on out, I'm not gonna respond to friends references even if I get them :p I never seem to. Just assume I didn't get it.
[3/31/17, 8:53:16 AM] Koushik Bhavani: We are definitely not the arsenal 😐😐
[3/31/17, 8:56:32 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Chokers ✅
Title drought ✅
Fans don't care about titles ✅
Want their manager/owner out ✅
[3/31/17, 8:56:54 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Red jersey ✅
[3/31/17, 8:56:56 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Disgraced ❌
[3/31/17, 8:56:58 AM] Koushik Bhavani: we dont want our manager/owner out
[3/31/17, 8:57:16 AM] Koushik Bhavani: we do care about titles
[3/31/17, 8:57:24 AM] Koushik Bhavani: what absolute bs
[3/31/17, 8:57:26 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Last season was full uproar about mallaya
[3/31/17, 8:57:42 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: Who's Mallaya? 😂😂
[3/31/17, 8:57:49 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Mallya != RCB
[3/31/17, 8:57:52 AM] Koushik Bhavani: 😂😂
[3/31/17, 8:58:07 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Yeah. That's the only comeback you guys have
[3/31/17, 8:58:24 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: That and we've come back to play the IPL.
[3/31/17, 8:58:28 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: It's not a comeback. Honest question 😂
[3/31/17, 8:58:53 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Don't make me reiterate my comments bro. No use, I say
[3/31/17, 8:59:17 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: And why all this arguing? Let's just agree RCB is awesome. Peace ✌🏼
[3/31/17, 8:59:30 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Dude I'd rather have 0 titles and stay in the league than win all 9 IPLs and get thrown out :p
[3/31/17, 8:59:46 AM] Prithvi Shankar: @14129613758
[3/31/17, 8:59:56 AM] Prithvi Shankar: ^
[3/31/17, 8:59:59 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: That's me, not the team. I don't represent the team's opinion
[3/31/17, 9:00:24 AM] Koushik Bhavani: virat is someone who wants to win more than anyone else
[3/31/17, 9:00:31 AM] Koushik Bhavani: everyone knows that
[3/31/17, 9:00:56 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: Virat 😍
[3/31/17, 9:00:58 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Okay?! Everyone wants to win bro. That's why it's a competition
[3/31/17, 9:01:44 AM] Koushik Bhavani: we are also the team with most support
[3/31/17, 9:01:56 AM] Prithvi Shankar: What balls
[3/31/17, 9:02:10 AM] Prithvi Shankar: CSK won this hands down every season
[3/31/17, 9:02:10 AM] Koushik Bhavani: easily
[3/31/17, 9:02:25 AM] Koushik Bhavani: lol ok😛
[3/31/17, 9:02:42 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: Eh CSK is nowhere in this contest. KKR comes close
[3/31/17, 9:03:01 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: And maybe Mumbai :P
[3/31/17, 9:03:08 AM] Koushik Bhavani: exactly
[3/31/17, 9:03:43 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Go check twitter bro
[3/31/17, 9:03:50 AM] Prithvi Shankar: 2.5 million followers for csk

[3/31/17, 9:04:24 AM] Prithvi Shankar: 2.4 and 2.3 for Mi and kkr
[3/31/17, 9:04:30 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Rcb is not even in top 3😂😂😂
[3/31/17, 9:04:43 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Most support it seems
[3/31/17, 9:04:43 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Twitter? That's what you're comparing?
[3/31/17, 9:04:44 AM] Koushik Bhavani: go check facebook fans
[3/31/17, 9:05:04 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Dude. You also?
[3/31/17, 9:05:10 AM] Prithvi Shankar: How do you calculate fan Base? Twitter is a good measure
[3/31/17, 9:05:10 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Social networks are fucking irrelevant.
[3/31/17, 9:05:20 AM] Koushik Bhavani: anyways people like me gautam and sunil arent even on twitter i think
[3/31/17, 9:06:09 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I am. But I bet a big percentage of people who show up to support RCB aren't.
[3/31/17, 9:06:37 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: Dude does CSK have Danish Sait? Thassal!

[3/31/17, 9:07:26 AM] Koushik Bhavani: this social media is bs only
[3/31/17, 9:07:28 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: Mr. Nags >>>>> a million titles
[3/31/17, 9:07:45 AM] Koushik Bhavani: we get support from other stadiums also
[3/31/17, 9:07:47 AM] Prithvi Shankar: What happened to this @14129613758
[3/31/17, 9:07:54 AM] Koushik Bhavani: and that too kolkata
[3/31/17, 9:07:54 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Stay consistent with your thoughts
[3/31/17, 9:08:07 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: He was sinking to your level.
[3/31/17, 9:08:13 AM] Koushik Bhavani: no i realised after googling more and that i myself am not one:-p
[3/31/17, 9:08:32 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Rising *

[3/31/17, 9:09:20 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: We don't harass cheerleaders also. We're also the most decent crowd.
[3/31/17, 9:09:38 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Random stat with no backing
[3/31/17, 9:09:40 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: There's no other nags. That's the point 😂
[3/31/17, 9:09:43 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Case dismissed
[3/31/17, 9:09:58 AM] Koushik Bhavani: no backing?
[3/31/17, 9:10:06 AM] Koushik Bhavani: have u even seen rcb games?:-p

[3/31/17, 9:11:48 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Btw Eden gardens has the most crowd
[3/31/17, 9:11:50 AM] Prithvi Shankar: You're wrong
[3/31/17, 9:11:58 AM] Prithvi Shankar: It's time to accept the truth some times
[3/31/17, 9:12:04 AM] Koushik Bhavani: arre thats bcoz their stadium is big
[3/31/17, 9:12:09 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: Prithvi you should realise by now that now one cares what you argue. You're just wasting your breath. We're all die hard RCB fans and nothing's gonna change that 🙃
[3/31/17, 9:12:52 AM] Prithvi Shankar: I never asked you to change 😂 just wanted to update your hopes about winning the title this season
[3/31/17, 9:12:55 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: Let's just leave it at that :)
[3/31/17, 9:13:07 AM] Koushik Bhavani: we have sarfaraz
[3/31/17, 9:13:11 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: Cooool
[3/31/17, 9:13:19 AM] Prithvi Shankar: This is what I first sent
[3/31/17, 9:13:32 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: Exactly. He's captaining 😎
[3/31/17, 9:19:32 AM] Koushik Bhavani: one thing though how does it feel to not have any team to support:-p
[3/31/17, 9:20:19 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: He's supporting Gujarat I think?
[3/31/17, 9:22:07 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Took you half hour to come up with that 👏🏽
[3/31/17, 9:22:20 AM] Prithvi Shankar: I just support csk players
[3/31/17, 9:23:12 AM] Prithvi Shankar: This season. I'll support rpsg mostly over gl
[3/31/17, 9:23:22 AM] Koushik Bhavani: no i just wanted to know so i can trash talk that team in the future
[3/31/17, 9:24:01 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Do it all you want this season for next season the invincibles return
[3/31/17, 9:24:17 AM] Koushik Bhavani: players, if u talk about that how can u not support rcb players:-p
[3/31/17, 9:24:34 AM] Prithvi Shankar: I support CSK
[3/31/17, 9:24:39 AM] Prithvi Shankar: And since they aren't here
[3/31/17, 9:24:43 AM] Prithvi Shankar: I support the players
[3/31/17, 9:24:56 AM] Prithvi Shankar: I don't support nehra for example even though he was cskn
[3/31/17, 9:25:04 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Because he's not in rpsg or gl now
[3/31/17, 9:25:23 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Ashwin also ruled out of ipl
[3/31/17, 9:25:34 AM] Koushik Bhavani: ya i heard
[3/31/17, 10:41:50 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: That's not true. The ones who _actually_ don't care wouldn't have 100+ messages spam if  nobody cared :P
[3/31/17, 10:45:47 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: What I meant was "Our support for RCB will not change even if lots of really good arguments about why they aren't good or why they won't win are put forth because we're just die hard fans". Not that I don't care about the discussion :P
[3/31/17, 11:05:15 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: But isn't that illogical 😶
[3/31/17, 11:05:32 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: You chooooose to be illogical? Ouch. :P
[3/31/17, 11:06:30 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: Everything can't be defined by logic Avk. Religion wouldn't exist if it could 🙃
[3/31/17, 11:07:42 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: There's a huge difference between religion and blind faith though. Former is sensible while the later is to be frowned upon 🙃
[3/31/17, 11:07:56 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: Dude
[3/31/17, 11:08:02 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Dude
[3/31/17, 11:08:08 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: The basis of religion is tyre existence of God
[3/31/17, 11:08:12 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: That's blind faith
[3/31/17, 11:08:22 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: Do you have evidence of God?
[3/31/17, 11:08:27 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: *the
[3/31/17, 11:09:03 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: Ok let's have this philosophical debate some other time please. Algo mid term coming up 😂
[3/31/17, 11:09:41 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I was gonna say depends on religion. But that'll make debate messy. So let's not :P
[3/31/17, 11:09:58 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: Yes :P
[3/31/17, 11:38:41 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: @14129612581 all roads lead to philosophy :p

[4/3/17, 12:36:06 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Hey everyone, our project at the ETC, Project Hindsight, needs playtesters for the story of our experience. It's a simple paper prototype (we will bring a VR prototype to campus soon as well) and it'll take you about 10-15 minutes to test it for us. 
This is happening today (starting very soon) at the UC, I'll let you know where exactly. 

I'm not at the UC, but I'll send you photos showing where my teammates are. 

It'd help us a lot if you guys tested it and gave us your feedback, so if you have time, please do it! Thank you.
[4/3/17, 12:44:19 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: <‎image omitted>

[4/5/17, 9:38:56 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: https://www.facebook.com/GLBLCTZN/videos/1317889278306837/
[4/6/17, 6:17:35 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Free food in 1507
[4/6/17, 6:18:29 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Till 9.30 😛
[4/6/17, 6:29:38 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: So early in the morning
[4/6/17, 6:48:07 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I know
[4/6/17, 6:48:12 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: It was shitty though
[4/6/17, 6:48:18 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Don't go even if you want to
[4/6/17, 6:48:30 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: It's still lying there, the food
[4/6/17, 7:12:31 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: https://www.facebook.com/BrainHumorOfficial/videos/1976248422598386/
[4/6/17, 7:14:42 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Oh god it's become so mainstream :p
[4/6/17, 7:17:05 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: I know! 😂
[4/6/17, 7:17:18 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: There's at least one new one every week!
[4/6/17, 7:20:17 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: https://www.facebook.com/Drsundayadelaja/videos/1614266751934439/
[4/6/17, 7:20:28 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: 😂
[4/6/17, 7:22:47 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: And now my flatmate is listening to it in the bathroom 🙈
[4/6/17, 8:49:55 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Guys, d'you want to do either paintball or biryani night this Saturday?
[4/6/17, 8:50:33 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Koushik and I most likely won't be able to come next weekend because of a project deadline on Monday 😔
[4/6/17, 8:51:06 AM] Shivam Gupta: Biryani!!
[4/6/17, 9:05:23 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: Biryani!
[4/6/17, 9:09:06 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Guys supposing I had a mass of leftover food, would a robot be able to sort out the proteins from the reat
[4/6/17, 9:09:09 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: *rest
[4/6/17, 9:09:30 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: People, grubhub recommendations?
[4/6/17, 9:09:33 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I hunger.
[4/6/17, 9:10:06 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Define mass of leftover food
[4/6/17, 9:10:37 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Depends on how cooked etc. maybe food is no?
[4/6/17, 9:10:53 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Difficult even for a human
[4/6/17, 9:11:50 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: I don't know if it can be done by virtue of the nutrient type, but maybe if we train the robot to know that if a food looks a certain way, then it's a protein, it's possible
[4/6/17, 9:12:19 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: But. If you want a robot for this specific task
[4/6/17, 9:12:31 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Maybe there's a sensor that could tell you what's in the substance?
[4/6/17, 9:12:52 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: The robot sticks it in and then then knows what to separate out?
[4/6/17, 9:13:49 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: That's what I thought is more difficult
[4/6/17, 9:13:55 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Separating food, again, on what it looks like. Say it sticks the sensor at A, everything that looks like A is probably exhibiting same behaviour.
[4/6/17, 9:14:09 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Unless you already have a sensor ;)
[4/6/17, 9:14:36 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Yeah, if it already exists and we don't know about it, it may be easier
[4/6/17, 9:15:41 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Apparently a Raman Spectrometer type can be used
[4/6/17, 9:35:47 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Okay so right now options are comp vision, a sensor, or a Raman Spectrometer?
[4/6/17, 9:35:56 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Or some combination of the three?
[4/6/17, 9:40:18 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: I think the sensor would be just a Raman Spectrometer, if it's available commercially.
[4/6/17, 9:40:28 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Otherwise, the sensor would just be a camera
[4/6/17, 9:40:35 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: And this is super helpful, people, thank you :]
[4/6/17, 9:40:42 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Ahh okay
[4/6/17, 9:53:19 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Nvm
[4/6/17, 9:56:05 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: i don't use it so no idea :/

[4/6/17, 10:27:13 AM] Koushik Bhavani: Shame
[4/6/17, 10:41:03 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I said nvm coz I already got the food.
[4/6/17, 10:46:38 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Lame

[4/6/17, 5:38:43 PM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: South oakland
[4/6/17, 5:40:11 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Okay so either red zone is late or it's cancelled
[4/6/17, 5:42:27 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: So I'm in campus only :p
[4/6/17, 5:42:34 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Where are you leaving from?
[4/6/17, 5:43:34 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Red zone was cancelled 😂
[4/6/17, 5:43:51 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: This is why you should use andysbuses :P
[4/6/17, 5:44:05 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: DO you keep checking the site?
[4/6/17, 5:44:24 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Just to see which buses are coming.

[4/6/17, 5:57:10 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Anyone know where Koushik is?
[4/6/17, 5:57:18 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: He isn't answering :/

[4/7/17, 8:53:12 AM] Maitreya Naik: Fuck off dude
[4/7/17, 8:53:58 AM] Maitreya Naik: It inspired the directors of the Matrix to create the Matrix. Milestone in the cyber punk genre after Akira

[4/9/17, 10:13:39 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: All these voice assistants could just as easily be apps on our phone right? and they could function by connecting to all the other apps?

[4/9/17, 10:32:12 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Alexa does a lot more than what Google's assistant and Siri can do on your phones
[4/9/17, 10:32:20 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: (I know it makes more money for them)
[4/9/17, 10:32:30 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: What more does it do?
[4/9/17, 10:33:50 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: It can stream music and videos, read ebooks, find and walk you through recipes, connect to your smart home devices and control them (like even lights and stuff, if they're IoT)
[4/9/17, 10:34:24 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Apparently it can order pizza 😅
[4/9/17, 10:35:56 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Ah okay so Alexa is being developed as a more universal method of voice control and Google and Siri are for your phone and laptop?
[4/9/17, 10:36:08 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Yeah
[4/9/17, 10:36:17 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Google I think has the equivalent of Alexa

[4/11/17, 7:41:57 AM] Shruti Rijhwani: Hii. Indian food truck today, anyone?
[4/11/17, 8:19:59 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: You're in a car accident. Glass shards are flying all around you. The passenger wanted to tell you something but before she could, you were sideswiped.
[4/11/17, 8:20:00 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: <‎audio omitted>
[4/11/17, 8:20:05 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Do they match ?
[4/11/17, 8:20:30 AM] Koushik Bhavani: I don't know if it matches

[4/11/17, 9:05:12 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Lunch time!
[4/11/17, 9:05:17 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Anyone else in?
[4/11/17, 3:39:40 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Do you think that, at some point, AI will be able to make recommendations to solve problems? Problems like, what new product should a company launch? As in it should take info available now and come up with an idea for a new one
[4/11/17, 3:39:56 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: If you think it is possible, any idea when it will be?
[4/11/17, 3:41:15 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Do you come up with these ideas and questions yourself?
[4/11/17, 3:41:33 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: If yes, I think you are very precious.
[4/11/17, 3:43:00 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Haha not entirely by myself
[4/11/17, 3:43:55 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: This one is kind of coming from a discussion we are having in class
[4/11/17, 3:45:05 PM] Shivam Gupta: This is possible. I am not sure about product recommendations though
[4/11/17, 3:45:38 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Okay then what is possible?
[4/11/17, 3:47:10 PM] Shivam Gupta: There are AI systems which recommends a way to solve a given programming problem
[4/11/17, 3:47:33 PM] Shivam Gupta: Currently it has capacity for simpler problems
[4/11/17, 3:47:51 PM] Shivam Gupta: I'll see if I can find the article I read about this
[4/11/17, 3:48:19 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Yep, please send it to me :]
[4/11/17, 3:48:38 PM] Shivam Gupta: The primary concern with such AI systems it the policy in accepting these recommendations
[4/11/17, 3:49:37 PM] Shivam Gupta: An example will be, would you trust the future of your company based on the result of an AI system?
[4/11/17, 3:49:37 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: When you say it recommends, are its recommendations based on knowledge in the past? Like, would it only recommend from algos that it already knows or might it also be able to make up a new algo?
[4/11/17, 3:50:24 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Oh yeah I think the control should be with a human in the end
[4/11/17, 3:50:27 PM] Shivam Gupta: The one I read focused on learning and recommending from its experience pool
[4/11/17, 3:50:35 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: But I am wondering about the feasibility right now
[4/11/17, 3:50:44 PM] Shivam Gupta: So not make up new algos
[4/11/17, 3:50:51 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: 👍🏾
[4/11/17, 3:51:08 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Definitely tell me if you see one that comes up with it's own algos :]
[4/11/17, 3:51:13 PM] Shivam Gupta: Elaborate little more please :] this is interesting
[4/11/17, 3:51:22 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: In class right now
[4/11/17, 3:51:29 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Let's discuss soon :]
[4/11/17, 3:51:49 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: This convo got more involved faster than I expected :P
[4/11/17, 3:53:51 PM] Shivam Gupta: Sure looking forward to it!

[4/11/17, 6:08:22 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: What ended up being the problem?
[4/11/17, 6:10:19 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: poojita's data got pushed to some folder that she didn't have access to and we didn't know which folder, so we had to modify permissions using root access and then figuring out where stuff is
[4/11/17, 6:10:38 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: it ended up being in the Java folder, wtflol
[4/11/17, 6:11:33 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: it was so exciting when we found it!!!!
[4/11/17, 6:17:35 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: How did that happen? 🤣

[4/14/17, 3:59:29 PM] Shivam Gupta: Today is optional :P

[4/14/17, 4:08:20 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Oh wait if you're watching tzp I'm out lol
[4/14/17, 4:09:12 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Seriously?! 😅
[4/14/17, 4:10:41 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Yeah man :p
[4/15/17, 8:27:02 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: <‎image omitted>
[4/15/17, 8:27:06 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: 😂
[4/15/17, 8:33:45 AM] Prithvi Shankar: 😂😂
[4/15/17, 8:39:24 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: <‎image omitted>
[4/15/17, 8:47:39 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Funny how?
[4/15/17, 8:48:27 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Coz so many of us use Snapchat.
[4/15/17, 8:51:50 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: But at the same time, we have a big percentage of rural population I guess.
[4/15/17, 8:53:45 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Yep
[4/15/17, 8:53:55 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I also don't get his logic
[4/15/17, 8:54:03 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: That's what I find funny :p
[4/15/17, 8:54:08 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Snapchat doesn't strike me as a rich people thing at all
[4/15/17, 8:54:12 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: It's free
[4/15/17, 8:54:31 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: He makes more money if more people see the ads and sponsored stuff
[4/15/17, 8:55:14 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: He dumb
[4/15/17, 8:55:55 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Like, this kind of stuff gets me so confused between real and fake news
[4/15/17, 9:00:50 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: This kinda stuff leaves me conflicted - part of me wants to delete the app and shove it in his face. But the other part of me goes 'filteeeeers' (jk, I just don't feel like deleting it) 
It's the whole 'life goes on' thing.
[4/15/17, 9:03:22 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Besides, just one delete won't make a difference to him anyway
[4/15/17, 9:12:23 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: Typical. That's how the US got Trump. I'd recommend you to value the power of your individual decisions.
[4/15/17, 9:15:11 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: And more than individual, you have a lot of influencing power as well
[4/15/17, 9:15:23 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Like if you delete it and tell other people,  they might also
[4/15/17, 9:15:35 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: So you might contribute to far more than one deletion
[4/15/17, 9:15:49 AM] Shruti Rijhwani: Boycott Snapchat!
[4/15/17, 9:16:08 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: Yes, boycott is the word.
[4/15/17, 9:16:28 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: It's very easy for me. I barely use it
[4/15/17, 9:16:31 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: Now, you should make sure that THAT news is real haha
[4/15/17, 9:17:30 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: Acts of passion during a storm... Ah.. What could be worse?
[4/15/17, 9:17:33 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Either way, it's not like there's no way to snap people without Snapchat
[4/15/17, 9:17:45 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Yep
[4/15/17, 9:17:47 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Everything has stories now
[4/15/17, 9:17:52 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I hear even MATLAB :p
[4/15/17, 9:18:29 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: (and I've deleted it already)
[4/15/17, 9:19:20 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: On my way to that
[4/15/17, 9:20:03 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: What about this, guys?
[4/15/17, 9:21:08 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I'll check that later today
[4/15/17, 9:21:22 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: And then tell my friends to boycott it if it's real
[4/15/17, 9:21:35 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Lunch time right now
[4/15/17, 9:21:48 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I looked it up on Google and a bunch of newspapers that I trust seem to be saying the same thing
[4/15/17, 9:21:59 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Might need to investigate further though
[4/15/17, 9:27:23 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: That statement is part of a set made by a former employee who is currently suing Snapchat. The statements were previously not open to the public, but have been made public recently
[4/15/17, 9:29:42 AM] Shruti Rijhwani: I never had it. I knew before it happened that it would fuck up. 🙃
[4/15/17, 9:30:52 AM] Shruti Rijhwani: Apparently the CEO is kind of a dick in general. They leaked his frat boy time emails.
[4/15/17, 9:31:08 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Shrootz = pro
[4/15/17, 9:33:02 AM] Shruti Rijhwani: https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/28/confirmed-snapchats-evan-spiegel-is-kind-of-an-ass/
[4/15/17, 9:33:49 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: I could install it and then delete it, if that helps :P
[4/15/17, 9:42:46 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Hahah
[4/15/17, 9:42:59 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: You could tweet to him that you're not going to install it
[4/15/17, 9:43:06 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: If you're on Twitter
[4/15/17, 9:58:37 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: That's so disturbing
[4/15/17, 10:13:11 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Oh yeah, I could do that
[4/15/17, 10:13:26 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: As soon as I figure out how to tweet at people
[4/15/17, 10:14:06 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: I use it more like a news notification app :P
[4/15/17, 10:16:20 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: You start writing a new tweet and include @evanspiegel somewhere in it
[4/15/17, 10:33:03 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: *Wow* he's an asshole
[4/15/17, 10:59:28 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Okay so
[4/15/17, 10:59:38 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: _can_ any one make it to the etc today?
[4/15/17, 11:03:51 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Sorry man, can't today
[4/15/17, 11:04:33 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: It'll be difficult for me
[4/15/17, 11:04:41 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Till when are they play testing?
[4/15/17, 11:05:33 AM] Koushik Bhavani: Sorry I can't come today 😅
[4/15/17, 11:08:13 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: When can you come? :P
[4/15/17, 11:08:30 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Guys, I have a question
[4/15/17, 11:08:47 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Can you have two I20s if you accept two colleges admits?
[4/15/17, 11:09:10 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Or is the system centralized and your first one is voided when you get issued the second one?
[4/15/17, 11:09:23 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: You can
[4/15/17, 11:09:58 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: But it's ethically not advised because they can't issue another admit if you decide not to go
[4/15/17, 11:10:32 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Okay
[4/15/17, 11:10:42 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: So it's not centralized?
[4/15/17, 11:10:57 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: One university can't know if another has already issued you an I20 or something?
[4/15/17, 11:11:06 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: No it's definitely possible. I know people who did
[4/15/17, 11:11:16 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: 👍🏽
[4/15/17, 12:16:08 PM] Koushik Bhavani: Guys what time today and which movie

[4/15/17, 1:51:13 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Just because I've seen it :P
[4/15/17, 1:51:51 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I haven't watched Sholay

[4/15/17, 1:57:55 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Obviously but then what movies? That's where my point comes in :P
[4/15/17, 1:58:19 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Whichever people want to watch though :)
[4/15/17, 1:59:06 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Fight fight
[4/15/17, 1:59:18 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Fight Club!!!!
[4/15/17, 2:15:03 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Haha anything is fine but at some point let's do new movies also

[4/15/17, 2:55:21 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: :o
[4/15/17, 2:55:38 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Yeah :p
[4/15/17, 3:09:45 PM] Koushik Bhavani: Tzp
[4/15/17, 3:17:49 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I need to make a call at about 8. Is there a place in RI that I can do that. Otherwise I'll come after I make the call
[4/15/17, 3:18:36 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I'm probably gonna be there late. Have a jam at 9:30

[4/16/17, 7:42:37 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I think that uninstalling it was a good idea either way, coz it was a waste of time and space :p
[4/16/17, 7:42:56 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: But there are people who've rated Snapdeal 1 star instead of Snapchat xD
[4/16/17, 7:54:31 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Yeah 😂
[4/16/17, 8:09:37 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Skype is amazingly cheap
[4/16/17, 8:09:55 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: If you want to call people who don't have internet

[4/16/17, 8:16:43 AM] Prithvi Shankar: 1c for Google hangouts 😁
[4/16/17, 8:16:50 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Dammit
[4/16/17, 8:17:02 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Shit 😔
[4/16/17, 8:21:22 AM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: Really?:O
[4/16/17, 8:21:41 AM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: Dates?
[4/16/17, 8:22:28 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Probably the first week
[4/16/17, 8:22:41 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: You have a plan?
[4/16/17, 8:25:02 AM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: I can go only after my internship ends:|
[4/16/17, 8:25:15 AM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: That's 11th August
[4/16/17, 8:25:23 AM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: I was thinking I'll bunk first week of school
[4/16/17, 8:27:43 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: August 11th is probably too late for me
[4/16/17, 8:27:43 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Go from like 15 th August to 2nd September
[4/16/17, 8:27:51 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I'll tell you my plan in two days
[4/16/17, 8:28:14 AM] Shivam Gupta: I might also come during this time
[4/16/17, 8:28:17 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: My school starts 27th September but wanted to go early and come back early
[4/16/17, 9:07:50 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: 😢
[4/16/17, 9:13:55 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: 😛
[4/16/17, 9:17:38 AM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: Let me know before you decide to book tickets: D
[4/16/17, 9:18:19 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: No
[4/16/17, 9:18:35 AM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: ☹️
[4/16/17, 6:14:32 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Can AI detect emotion which is not obviously stated?
[4/16/17, 6:15:12 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: From the script of a movie, say. If you or I were reading it, we would probably be able to tell if a character is jealous/happy/sad
[4/16/17, 6:18:00 PM] Abhilasha CMU: like detecting that if this sequence of events were to happen, somebody would probably be sad?
[4/16/17, 6:19:34 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: yep
[4/16/17, 6:20:33 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Maybe if the AI is watching a movie just like we watch movies
[4/16/17, 6:20:58 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: at any point if you pause the movie, can they figure out what the main characters are feeling?
[4/16/17, 6:21:03 PM] Prithvi Shankar: definitely. Sentiment analysis is a well researched topic
[4/16/17, 6:21:34 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Okay then a further question
[4/16/17, 6:22:43 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Would an AI be able to make some extrapolations? Like it has watched a movie about some characters, and then you give it a sequence of events. Would it be able to say that this character would be very happy/sad/amused...?
[4/16/17, 6:35:24 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Idk if this is related to what you want : https://peoples2016.github.io
[4/16/17, 6:38:11 PM] Shivam Gupta: It is different from what Aditi is saying I guess. This focuses more on social media emotion analysis
[4/16/17, 6:41:22 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: It's useful though
[4/16/17, 7:38:46 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Eh you guys remember this song uh?

[4/17/17, 10:49:25 AM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: Yes
[4/17/17, 10:49:42 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Phew. Thanks!

[4/17/17, 10:51:28 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Local Tate and federal

[4/17/17, 10:51:36 AM] Srijana Env.: Three forms for those who earned in 2016
[4/17/17, 10:51:40 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: 8843 is just federal

[4/17/17, 10:54:51 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I am also having some doubts about this but most people have told me that we only need to do the one form
[4/17/17, 10:55:18 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Only one 😛
[4/17/17, 10:55:26 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Sorry for the confusion :D

[4/17/17, 8:45:39 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Unless you're making garlic kozhambu
[4/17/17, 8:51:21 PM] Koushik Bhavani: its the best thing ever
[4/17/17, 8:54:30 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: You guys are spamming too much
[4/17/17, 9:33:04 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Shit. Attack on Titan season 2 doesn't waste any time no?
[4/17/17, 9:33:10 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Fucking awesome stuff
[4/17/17, 9:33:22 PM] Koushik Bhavani: The second episode was bull shit
[4/17/17, 9:33:26 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Sh
[4/17/17, 9:33:32 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I'm watching second episode now
[4/17/17, 9:33:41 PM] Koushik Bhavani: The first and third are awesome
[4/17/17, 9:35:39 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I'm happy Levi and Erwin are getting more screen time in the second episode :p those guys are just too good
[4/17/17, 9:35:49 PM] Koushik Bhavani: Levi 😍
[4/17/17, 9:36:02 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Boss only no?
[4/17/17, 9:36:08 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Every dialogue is so badass
[4/17/17, 9:36:22 PM] Koushik Bhavani: I swear
[4/17/17, 9:36:47 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It really makes me wonder about Erwin. How much cooler he must be.
[4/17/17, 9:37:04 PM] Koushik Bhavani: His tactics in first season
[4/17/17, 9:37:10 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Insane
[4/17/17, 9:37:17 PM] Koushik Bhavani: God level
[4/17/17, 9:50:09 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Mikasa hasn't got screen time 😭
[4/17/17, 9:50:55 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Yeah :/ but they're developing new characters. I've always wanted to know what Sasha's deal was.
[4/17/17, 9:51:50 PM] Koushik Bhavani: My one true love 😁
[4/17/17, 9:51:59 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: I don't even know why Eren exists. Without him, Mikasa would've been free and she'd have gone out and kicked ass
[4/17/17, 9:52:09 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Now all she does is protect him :/
[4/17/17, 9:52:36 PM] Koushik Bhavani: She's the best
[4/17/17, 9:53:10 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Koushik is the best
[4/17/17, 9:53:45 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Eh but Eren is cool man
[4/17/17, 9:54:10 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Only in his transformed state. He's a wuss otherwise :P
[4/17/17, 9:54:12 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: And honestly I rate Levi and Erwin above Mikasa :p
[4/17/17, 9:54:44 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Mikasa = Levi when her brother's in danger
[4/17/17, 9:54:56 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Brother ?
[4/17/17, 9:55:04 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I honestly think it's way more than that :p
[4/17/17, 9:55:20 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: What do you mean? :P
[4/17/17, 9:55:36 PM] Koushik Bhavani: Obviously 💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻
[4/17/17, 9:55:42 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It's some weird relationship man
[4/17/17, 9:55:45 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Ok we're spamming 😂
[4/17/17, 9:56:02 PM] Koushik Bhavani: Dude definitely not brother
[4/17/17, 9:56:04 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Well, yes.
[4/17/17, 9:56:04 PM] Koushik Bhavani: 😂
[4/17/17, 9:56:17 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: I mean I know not brother
[4/17/17, 9:56:19 PM] Koushik Bhavani: Not weird it's so obvious
[4/17/17, 9:56:20 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: That was the point of this conversation.
[4/17/17, 9:56:34 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Weird coz she keeps saying he's her family
[4/17/17, 9:56:38 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: But she treats him like a brother
[4/17/17, 9:57:04 PM] Koushik Bhavani: Naaa
[4/17/17, 9:57:17 PM] Koushik Bhavani: He's her one true love 😂
[4/17/17, 9:57:28 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Hence weird
[4/17/17, 9:59:59 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Btw
[4/17/17, 10:00:24 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I know about another titan. I kinda guessed because of something in season 1 and I think I'm right.
[4/17/17, 10:00:38 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I think even 2 more. Not just one.
[4/17/17, 10:01:30 PM] Koushik Bhavani: Ok I think we should create a different group 😂
[4/17/17, 10:01:40 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Yeah we should :p
[4/17/17, 11:06:41 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: What are you guys talking about?
[4/17/17, 11:09:27 PM] Maitreya Naik: The only reason I read the last few messages was because I read Mikasa and Levi. Didn't know you guys have watched Shingeki no Kyojin
[4/17/17, 11:11:38 PM] Maitreya Naik: How's the new season going? The trailer revealed more from the future than I expected it to
[4/17/17, 11:12:47 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: It's good! They're building a whole new set of characters and introducing new titans
[4/17/17, 11:13:36 PM] Maitreya Naik: Ya. That's what I meant. I'm​ way ahead in the manga and the trailer showed 2 of the New major Titans already
[4/17/17, 11:14:25 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Oh then shush :P
[4/17/17, 11:15:00 PM] Maitreya Naik: Lot more they showed in the trailer which I won't say. But awesome. I'm gonna watch it as soon as this semester gets over. One of the few best action anime with great progression in the past half decade
[4/17/17, 11:15:41 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Yeah I want to wait and binge watch it, but can't control myself :P
[4/17/17, 11:16:29 PM] Maitreya Naik: Keep discussing 😁 Given the trailer, there is a lot more awesome action and mysteries coming up than the first season
[4/17/17, 11:16:39 PM] Maitreya Naik: Haha. Luxury of time
[4/17/17, 11:16:50 PM] Maitreya Naik: And heavy brains:P
[4/17/17, 11:22:25 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: 😏

[4/17/17, 11:24:16 PM] Maitreya Naik: Meh

[4/17/17, 11:25:39 PM] Maitreya Naik: It's only 17% per assignment? So 8%. that's not a problem
[4/17/17, 11:25:55 PM] Maitreya Naik: I have other more worthy projects to focus on
[4/17/17, 11:26:04 PM] Prithvi Shankar: I was kidding dude. You can use 3 days 😁✌🏽
[4/17/17, 11:26:16 PM] Maitreya Naik: Lol 😂

[4/27/17, 9:35:47 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: A man was driving down the road and his car broke down near a monastery. He went to the monastery and knocked on the door. An elderly monk answered the door, and he said, "My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?" The monks graciously welcomed him into the monastery, fed him dinner, even fixed his car. As the man tried to fall asleep, he heard a strange sound. The next morning, he asked the monks what the sound was, but they said, "We can't tell you. You're not a monk." The man was disappointed, but thanked them and went on his way. Some years later, the same man broke down in front of the same monastery. The monks welcomed him, fed him, even fixed his car. That night, he heard the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier. The next morning, he asked what the noise was, but the monks replied, "We can't tell you. You're not a monk." The man said, "All right, all right. I'm dying to know. How do I become a monk?" The monks replied, "You must travel the Earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk." The man set about his task. Forty-five years later, he returned and knocked on the door of the monastery. He said, "I have traveled the Earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the Earth." The monks replied, "Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound." The monks led the man to a wooden door, where the head monk said, "The sound is right behind that door." The man reached for the knob, but the door was locked. He said, "Real funny. may I have the key?" The monks gave him the key, and he opened the door. Behind the wooden door was another door made of stone. The man demanded the key to the stone door. The monks gave him the key, and he opened it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demanded another key from the monks, who provided it. Behind that door was another door, this one made of sapphire. So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst. Finally, the monks said, "This is the last key to the last door." The man was relieved to no end. He unlocked the door, turned the knob, and behind that door he was amazed to find the source of that strange sound. But I can't tell you what it was because you're not a monk.

[5/22/17, 6:00:31 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I can always look stuff up though :p
[5/22/17, 6:02:35 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: That's the best way. Since it's either C++ or Python based. If you know one of the two you are good to go :)
[5/22/17, 6:02:48 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: You don't disappoint :)
[5/22/17, 6:02:55 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Just kidding 😛

[5/22/17, 6:15:50 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: :P Where's this from?
[5/22/17, 6:15:59 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Frasier :p

[5/22/17, 6:19:32 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: 👌 Neat.
[5/22/17, 6:20:09 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Never watched it. Is it worth it?
[5/22/17, 6:20:10 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I know Aditi is close to Boston. Anyone else? In Boston?
[5/22/17, 6:20:25 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Definitely.
[5/22/17, 7:25:43 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Hahaha full swag
[5/22/17, 7:26:31 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Why? What makes it so horrible?
[5/22/17, 7:26:57 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: And yep I am close to Boston, what's up?

[5/24/17, 4:35:53 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Go back to sleep
[5/24/17, 4:38:39 AM] Prithvi Shankar: 😂😂
[5/24/17, 4:43:51 AM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: What plans for the long weekend, guys?
[5/24/17, 4:45:46 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Which one is the long one?
[5/24/17, 4:45:58 AM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: The coming weekend
[5/24/17, 4:46:02 AM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: Monday is off
[5/24/17, 4:46:20 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Oh
[5/24/17, 4:46:34 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Come here, we'll figure it out 😁
[5/24/17, 4:47:24 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Take Sanjay's advice, @14122189517
[5/24/17, 8:46:15 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Guys. Quick question
[5/24/17, 8:47:17 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Given a triangle in 3D space, (you know the three vertices' positions), given an xz co-ordinate, how do you quickly find the y corresponding to the triangle? Is there no better way than finding the equation of the plane itself?
[5/24/17, 8:48:18 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: All three xz are given hmm?
[5/24/17, 8:49:42 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Wait what's given to us again?
[5/24/17, 8:49:45 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Why isn't that a good way?
[5/24/17, 8:50:22 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: We know the vertices of the triangle. And the xz of another point. We need to find the y so that it is in the plane of the triangle
[5/24/17, 8:50:57 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Cross profuct
[5/24/17, 8:51:00 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It isn't a good way coz I have to code it
[5/24/17, 8:51:05 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Dot product with a side
[5/24/17, 8:51:07 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: :p
[5/24/17, 8:51:16 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Dot product with normal sorry
[5/24/17, 8:51:20 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Should be zero
[5/24/17, 8:51:42 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Got it?
[5/24/17, 8:51:48 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Dot product of what?
[5/24/17, 8:51:51 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: You could do some kind of distance calculation. Vary the y coordinate and calculate the distances from all three. Least distance in some way (avg, total, individual? ) should give you the optimum y
[5/24/17, 8:52:22 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Yeah I was trying to interpolate the y
[5/24/17, 8:52:31 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Hm no, it would have to be distance along the plane
[5/24/17, 8:52:37 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: 1 method: take cross product of a side with the vector joining one vertex and the new unknown point. Dot product that with normal and equate to zero. One equation one variable
[5/24/17, 8:52:59 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: 2nd method:
[5/24/17, 8:53:37 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Ugh. Other methods I can think of still have cross product
[5/24/17, 8:53:44 AM] Maitreya Naik: If you have xz then you have a line infinite in y values
[5/24/17, 8:54:00 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Yeah got it.
[5/24/17, 8:54:03 AM] Maitreya Naik: You're basically trying to find the intersection of that line with the 3 sides of the triangles then
[5/24/17, 8:54:14 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: That should be easy to do I think. Thanks man
[5/24/17, 8:54:41 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: He wants the y in the plane, Mai.
[5/24/17, 8:54:46 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Oh yeah
[5/24/17, 8:54:57 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: No problem!
[5/24/17, 8:55:22 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: As in the plane *
[5/24/17, 8:55:22 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I'll come back if I fuck up heheh
[5/24/17, 8:55:29 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: 👍😁
[5/24/17, 9:07:22 AM] Maitreya Naik: Mmmm... You think so? Won't it be 2 or 3 points? Or a line?
[5/24/17, 9:08:21 AM] Maitreya Naik: Oh you mean the triangle is a plane. Not just a set of 3 lines
[5/24/17, 9:08:24 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Unless the y axis is in the plane, no, right?
[5/24/17, 9:08:34 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Yep 😁
[5/24/17, 9:09:52 AM] Maitreya Naik: I see. Ya now I get your techniques. Nice.
Still then, given the xz, what he is looking for can only be a line or points, right? Since only one dimension is variable?
[5/24/17, 9:10:51 AM] Maitreya Naik: Ya. Then it's the y-axis (or a line parallel to it if that's what you mean) which is a line
[5/24/17, 9:13:43 AM] Maitreya Naik: Don't you mean cross product with normal to zero?
[5/24/17, 9:15:15 AM] Maitreya Naik: Since the cross product between a side and this phantom vector should ideally give a vector parallel to the normal of the triangle. And hence the angle between the phantom vector and the normal should be zero. Hence their cross product should be 0 and dot product should be the product of the norms of the two vectors
[5/24/17, 9:15:52 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: My bad :P
[5/24/17, 9:15:57 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Two cross products
[5/24/17, 9:16:04 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Ayyooo Sunil come back 😛
[5/24/17, 9:16:41 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Sin and Cos always confuse me dangit
[5/24/17, 9:18:14 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Yeah I knew that was a mistake
[5/24/17, 9:18:33 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I just took Dot product with normal and difference between this point and one of the verts
[5/24/17, 9:18:40 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: And equated that to zero instead.
[5/24/17, 9:18:42 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Simpler
[5/24/17, 9:18:54 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: But yeah thanks man :) it works
[5/24/17, 9:19:12 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: That's what I probably meant back then 😛
[5/24/17, 9:19:33 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Smarter :D
No problem 😁
[5/24/17, 9:20:04 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Wait
[5/24/17, 9:20:06 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: No
[5/24/17, 9:20:08 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Nonono
[5/24/17, 9:20:13 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Still cross producy
[5/24/17, 9:20:15 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Aaarrggh
[5/24/17, 9:20:37 AM] Maitreya Naik: What?
[5/24/17, 9:20:44 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Take cross product bro
[5/24/17, 9:20:51 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: And equate it to zero
[5/24/17, 9:21:03 AM] Maitreya Naik: Makes sense though
[5/24/17, 9:21:16 AM] Maitreya Naik: But multiple points
[5/24/17, 9:21:19 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Lol it's Dot only
[5/24/17, 9:21:21 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Difference of the cross product with one of the vertices
[5/24/17, 9:21:28 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: It's still parallel to the normal no
[5/24/17, 9:21:44 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Oh
[5/24/17, 9:21:49 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Only one variable still
[5/24/17, 9:21:50 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Normal is perpendicular to difference between points so dot works.
[5/24/17, 9:21:56 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Understood
[5/24/17, 9:22:02 AM] Maitreya Naik: Ya
[5/24/17, 9:22:15 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Works
[5/24/17, 9:22:26 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Yup I tested it already lol
[5/24/17, 9:22:45 AM] Maitreya Naik: Much Ado about nothing 😂
[5/24/17, 9:22:52 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: You made me feel like an idiot bro Sunil
[5/24/17, 9:22:57 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: -.-
[5/24/17, 9:24:36 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: You did that to me too :p I just forgot how to use vectors before you said all the equate to zero things :p
[5/24/17, 9:24:53 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: And then I'm like 'duh doy'
[5/24/17, 9:26:12 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It must be these shoes.
[5/24/17, 9:28:10 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: @14129616423 it's a known symptom in PhD candidates to abuse of cross-products :D
[5/24/17, 9:29:08 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Sign that I am embracing the PhD in me? Good to know :P

[5/24/17, 4:40:06 PM] Shrivani CMU: Hahaha! Always a cheer for the person playing a guitar, Always!! 😛
[5/24/17, 4:40:12 PM] Shrivani CMU: You too Sunil! 😅
[5/24/17, 4:40:22 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Lol, on videos, with playback, post-editing, make-up, and on the beach
[5/24/17, 4:40:28 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Dude. First step to wooing a girl is not to grab her attention to you. But something that you do. Person is boring. It's what he does that matters.
[5/24/17, 4:40:32 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I need to write a book
[5/24/17, 4:40:34 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: I could lend you mine

[5/24/17, 7:40:36 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Tell him to buy one to each of his followers (ditchers 😒)
[5/24/17, 7:41:23 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I'll ask. He brags about how much money he has. I'll catch him then 😛

[5/24/17, 7:52:06 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: - - - battery
+ + + apps
+ + weight
+ + color
+ responsiveness
- -  comfortable for the eye

same price
[5/24/17, 7:57:29 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Comfort to the eyes is sucky here? That's weird
[5/24/17, 7:57:41 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: OMG I'm buying it
[5/24/17, 7:58:13 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Is it only for black and white?
[5/24/17, 8:00:02 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Yes
[5/25/17, 5:38:32 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/tejas-express-first-trip-from-mumbai-to-goa-passengers-steal-headphones-damaged-screens/story-Kc9StIfm5YERT4CtrT9OxI.html
[5/25/17, 5:38:35 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: :/
[5/25/17, 5:43:12 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: :(
[5/25/17, 7:01:05 AM] Shrivani CMU: Damn :/
[5/25/17, 10:22:58 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: In a block chain,  what is a miner? I know what a miner does, but is the term referring to a person, a code, an algorithm?
[5/25/17, 10:23:10 AM] Shivam Gupta: Person
[5/25/17, 10:23:31 AM] Shivam Gupta: These people get commission for the mining they do
[5/25/17, 10:23:50 AM] Shivam Gupta: That's how they make e-money
[5/25/17, 10:24:02 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: :
[5/25/17, 10:24:04 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: :0
[5/25/17, 10:24:20 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Seriously people sit and try to decrypt blocks?
[5/25/17, 10:24:32 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: They earn in bit coins?
[5/25/17, 10:24:50 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: In the case of the bit coin block chain ^
[5/25/17, 10:25:46 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: And why is this considered peer to peer? Isn't the bitcoin blockchain also an intermediary?
[5/25/17, 10:27:13 AM] Shivam Gupta: They have specific software for that
[5/25/17, 10:27:27 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: The people have software?
[5/25/17, 10:27:51 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: So has an industry popped up around this? The decryption of blocks?
[5/25/17, 10:27:53 AM] Shivam Gupta: What do you mean by peer to peer?
[5/25/17, 10:28:05 AM] Shivam Gupta: It's a job
[5/25/17, 10:28:34 AM] Shivam Gupta: A miners job is to confirm the transactions made in a.block
[5/25/17, 10:29:21 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: The article I'm reading says that blockchain has enabled people to transact peer to peer, and not through an intermediary like a bank. Earlier a bank was needed to verify the authenticity of both transacting parties
[5/25/17, 10:29:43 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: But I'm wondering why the bitcoin network doesn't count as the intermediary here
[5/25/17, 10:34:54 AM] Shivam Gupta: Maybe because anyone can become a miner, all you need is the supporting hardware and software
[5/25/17, 1:21:58 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: If a form asks me "Are you currently on OPT?", should my answer be Yes or No?
[5/25/17, 1:22:11 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I never gave a shit about the OPT business, so I am not sure
[5/25/17, 1:22:11 PM] Prithvi Shankar: No I guess
[5/25/17, 1:22:16 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Okay, thanks!
[5/25/17, 1:22:31 PM] Prithvi Shankar: Opt is after curriculum work
[5/25/17, 1:22:39 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Oh I see..
[5/25/17, 1:22:49 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: So it's a No then
[5/25/17, 1:22:51 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Cool :D
[5/25/17, 1:22:53 PM] Prithvi Shankar: None of us except Deepak is in opt

[5/25/17, 6:04:05 PM] Koushik Bhavani: True team player ❤
[5/25/17, 6:04:21 PM] Maitreya Naik: E&I/EEE and then partying. Who would have time between those 2 😛
[5/25/17, 6:04:24 PM] Koushik Bhavani: I swear undergrad was when you could start everything new
[5/25/17, 6:04:37 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Because he's awesome! Also what Koushik said :P
[5/25/17, 6:05:09 PM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: I had a life? Maybe that's why
[5/25/17, 6:05:24 PM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: Honestly the internet speed sucked😂

[5/25/17, 6:09:31 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: I came 😬
[5/25/17, 6:11:04 PM] Maitreya Naik: Most nights actually after a very good walk 😛
[5/25/17, 6:11:18 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: I sat outside for like 15 minutes and your warden gave me bad looks 😒
[5/25/17, 6:11:35 PM] Maitreya Naik: Can't sit on the steps bro

[5/26/17, 4:41:18 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Positives and negatives
[5/26/17, 4:41:42 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Seemed sort of believable for Modi's govt

[5/28/17, 2:30:50 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I guess it would depend on how it was handled, though
[5/28/17, 2:32:14 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Guess so.

[5/30/17, 12:04:03 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I will look up Rollin
[5/30/17, 12:30:13 PM] Shrivani CMU: People who have TMobile, download the app called t mobile Tuesdays. You can watch wonder woman for $4 this week.
[5/30/17, 12:33:23 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Done!
[5/30/17, 12:34:09 PM] Shivam Gupta: Yes!
[5/30/17, 12:36:30 PM] Maitreya Naik: Oh shit!
[5/30/17, 12:36:36 PM] Maitreya Naik: Someone buy a ticket for me!
[5/30/17, 1:59:44 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Basketball in an hour!
[5/30/17, 2:00:16 PM] Shrivani CMU: 👍🏼
[5/30/17, 2:15:23 PM] Shivam Gupta: Yes!
[5/30/17, 2:34:14 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: I can't play today :(

[5/30/17, 3:04:34 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: I'll be there by 6:30
[5/30/17, 3:04:50 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Thanks, got it! 😁
[5/30/17, 4:29:27 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: This is so fascinating. Has he tried to see if words might have different colours depending on the time period? Like maybe a 1000 years back, words were associated with different colours?
[5/30/17, 4:54:26 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Data? : P
[5/30/17, 4:54:32 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: :P
[5/30/17, 5:31:23 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Huh?
[5/30/17, 5:35:28 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Do you mean what data could be used?
[5/30/17, 5:36:22 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I was thinking any written texts by themselves to understand relationships like "green with envy"
[5/30/17, 5:37:17 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Also anything verbal that we can to voice to text for (if text is the basic variable)
[5/30/17, 5:37:56 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: And also if possible some sort of relationship extraction between photos,  paintings,  sculpture etc and descriptions for the same
[5/30/17, 5:38:46 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Like if a person is painted flushing deeply and the description says that the artist has done so because the person is embarrassed,  you could extract shades even
[5/31/17, 4:36:46 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=783960548449813&id=352364611609411
[5/31/17, 5:27:18 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Very cool
[5/31/17, 5:27:52 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I'm sure people will create weird kinds of pasta and then traditionalists will decry the lack of culture these days and say that pasta is being ruined
[5/31/17, 5:38:05 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It's already happening in the comments
[5/31/17, 9:15:28 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Boo
[5/31/17, 9:16:08 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Board Games night this weekend?

[5/31/17, 10:18:43 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Covfefe!
[5/31/17, 10:19:59 PM] Shivam Gupta: Now I'll send try to figure it out and enjoy at 6 in the morning :P
[5/31/17, 10:21:57 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: After 6 hours of not deleting the tweet
[5/31/17, 10:24:08 PM] Shivam Gupta: And not one of his staff noticed😂
[6/1/17, 6:31:57 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It should be noted that no ethically-trained software engineer would ever consent to write a NukeChicago procedure. 

Basic professional ethics would instead require him to write a NukeCity procedure, to which Chicago could be given as a parameter.
[6/1/17, 6:38:33 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: 😂
[6/1/17, 6:39:17 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: And by basic ethics you mean his programming 101 prof whose voice he forever remembers saying _Don't hardcode_?
[6/1/17, 6:44:44 AM] Prithvi Shankar: <‎image omitted>
[6/1/17, 6:44:49 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Flawlessdemon
[6/1/17, 6:48:03 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: More generalization than hardcoding, but yes haha.
[6/1/17, 6:49:19 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Hahah
[6/1/17, 9:40:17 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: https://www.altnews.in/coordinated-troll-attack-makemytrip-com-following-tweet-co-founder-ease-business/
[6/1/17, 9:40:30 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Majority of Indians are quite fucked up in the head.
[6/1/17, 9:40:32 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: No?
[6/1/17, 9:45:26 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Also this is a very sensible article around IITM issue:

https://www.google.com/amp/www.firstpost.com/india/iit-madras-beef-row-extreme-right-left-divide-leaves-no-room-for-dialogue-iits-silence-makes-things-worse-3503713.html/amp
[6/1/17, 9:45:47 AM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: Omg!
[6/1/17, 9:45:55 AM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: People are crazy
[6/1/17, 9:46:15 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: (one article whose views I support fully)
[6/1/17, 10:02:28 AM] Shrivani CMU: This is so sad! I don't understand the sentiment such ppl are following anymore :/
[6/1/17, 10:02:41 AM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: True
[6/1/17, 10:17:54 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: 😢
[6/1/17, 10:18:17 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I'm  ot really questioning their methods,  but the reasoning behind it
[6/1/17, 10:18:22 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: *not
[6/1/17, 10:28:23 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: They think they are supporting/protecting Hinduism
[6/1/17, 10:28:39 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: But they are the ones fucking it 😅
[6/1/17, 10:29:22 AM] Shrivani CMU: But even worse, why are they imposing it on others...or supporting ppl who are doing that in a secular country.
[6/1/17, 10:30:38 AM] Shrivani CMU: It's painful to watch people acting proud of having such diversity and then resorting to such base actions.
[6/1/17, 10:31:45 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I don't care about any of this shit. It hurts to care.
[6/1/17, 10:32:36 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Does anyone know where I can get 64 bit opencv DLLs?
[6/1/17, 10:32:49 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I'm losing my shit looking for them.
[6/1/17, 10:37:18 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: True :/
But according Arnab Goswamy (😅) the ban is on slaughter on roads and market places. Not registered and licensed slaughter houses. If that's the case it's a good law. Although the law on JUST beef makes it seem motivated by religious interest :/
[6/1/17, 10:40:48 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Yeah I wonder what's okay about slaughtering a chicken on yhe road
[6/1/17, 10:44:23 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: https://www.quora.com/Why-should-one-learn-machine-learning-from-scratch-rather-than-just-learning-to-use-the-available-libraries/answer/Roman-Trusov?share=c303bcd6&srid=iyzJ
[6/1/17, 10:44:25 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Thoughts?
[6/1/17, 10:57:58 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Wholeheartedly agree.
[6/1/17, 10:58:03 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Not just with ML.
[6/1/17, 10:58:25 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: But it's very important to know what's out there in case it does reduce the work you do.
[6/1/17, 10:58:32 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: You have to do*
[6/1/17, 1:12:32 PM] Shivam Gupta: Finals plans? For today?

[6/1/17, 1:37:55 PM] Maitreya Naik: It's an app where you can practice a language by talking to other app users from their native countries. You have to set yourself to be available to talk to others in your native language too
[6/1/17, 1:44:38 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Does Subra Suresh's decision have anything to do with the paris climate thing?
[6/1/17, 1:44:46 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: The last straw or whatever? Idk
[6/1/17, 1:44:54 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: #conspiracytheory
[6/1/17, 1:55:55 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: :0
[6/1/17, 1:56:14 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: For the resignation
[6/1/17, 1:56:18 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: It was a surprise, didn't see it coming
[6/1/17, 1:57:10 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: This is the first time a president has had such a short term at cmu
[6/1/17, 3:09:03 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Woah!
[6/1/17, 3:15:16 PM] Prithvi Shankar: Hahaha

[6/1/17, 3:20:37 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Amaze. ❤
[6/1/17, 3:26:02 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Yup!
[6/1/17, 3:28:06 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Very much agree with the sentiment. I don't like the rudeness though.. It feels especially odd because Trump was attacked for things like 'nasty woman'
[6/1/17, 3:35:57 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: A friend's friend is looking for someone interested in joining a start-up which will be developing a verification technology for phones
[6/1/17, 3:36:06 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Are any of you interested?
[6/1/17, 3:36:23 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: and is there a group of some sort for CS where a post could be put up?
[6/1/17, 3:39:42 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Facebook Computer Science
[6/1/17, 3:39:55 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: CMU* of course
[6/1/17, 3:41:15 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I found a page, not a Facebook group
[6/1/17, 3:41:18 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Can you send me a link?
[6/1/17, 3:49:35 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Gimme a sec

[6/1/17, 5:35:31 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: There's always dead birds outside the ETC man. I've had some dark days.
[6/1/17, 5:35:59 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It's even worse in the winter with the snow. They look hauntingly sad.
[6/1/17, 5:36:35 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: There is a very live bee in the room with me
[6/1/17, 5:37:37 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I just shuddered.

[6/1/17, 8:00:58 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: morning your own business?

[6/1/17, 8:31:24 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: So I tried hard to be a part of the UW group
[6/1/17, 8:31:31 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: But..People are just dumb ok?
[6/1/17, 8:31:42 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Shitty dialogues to which people laugh
[6/1/17, 8:32:20 PM] Prithvi Shankar: are you referring to your own dialogues as shitty? 😂
[6/1/17, 8:32:49 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I knew you'd say that. No. But the number of people who laughed to the rain dialogue would shock you.
[6/1/17, 8:33:13 PM] Prithvi Shankar: haha anything more than 1 would've shocked me
[6/1/17, 8:33:21 PM] Prithvi Shankar: would *

[6/1/17, 8:40:33 PM] Shrivani CMU: Not every day is a Sunday

[6/2/17, 4:34:09 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: You should definitely say boohoo, in a week :P
[6/2/17, 8:05:09 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Yeah :/
[6/2/17, 9:59:40 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Did you hear that?!
[6/2/17, 10:00:00 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: That's the sound of silence.
[6/2/17, 10:00:12 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Why is this group so silent? 😢
[6/2/17, 10:01:04 PM] Koushik Bhavani: Lol
[6/2/17, 10:01:05 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: These California people forgot about us. Ugh. We don't like you either. Effoofffff
[6/2/17, 10:01:11 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: -.-
[6/2/17, 10:01:16 PM] Koushik Bhavani: 😂
[6/2/17, 10:01:16 PM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: 😛
[6/2/17, 10:01:50 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: You're going  to be a Seattle person soon
[6/2/17, 10:02:07 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: You know the real reason?
[6/2/17, 10:02:23 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I'll be Sleepless in Seattle, missing you guys. Not like these Cali people :|
[6/2/17, 10:02:24 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Corporates expect you to come work way too early
[6/2/17, 10:02:25 PM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: We are making barbeque❤
[6/2/17, 10:02:40 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: And then you have to sit mostly in the same place the whole day
[6/2/17, 10:02:46 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Makes me feel too sleepy
[6/2/17, 10:03:04 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Corporates suck the life outta you
[6/2/17, 10:03:33 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: But you get the sense that you can do so much
[6/2/17, 10:03:40 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: They build up such huge systems
[6/2/17, 10:04:17 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I have a question
[6/2/17, 10:04:21 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Just a thought
[6/2/17, 10:04:47 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Think
[6/2/17, 10:04:51 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: There is this intuitive notion that start ups grow faster than big corporates right
[6/2/17, 10:05:16 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Yes supposedly
[6/2/17, 10:05:27 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: it's not just because they want to quickly grow but it's because they can
[6/2/17, 10:05:46 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Since they are small and easier to manage
[6/2/17, 10:05:52 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Also because as a percentage of what they already are, the same amount of growth is a large percentage
[6/2/17, 10:06:08 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Ignore percentage being there twice
[6/2/17, 10:06:23 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: But yep theoretically that also
[6/2/17, 10:06:58 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: They have some advantages in being nimble,  but also disadvantages in that they have not built up systems, processes, relations with vendors, supply chains, etc
[6/2/17, 10:07:22 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I was thinking
[6/2/17, 10:07:26 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Also if they don't grow, they will die faster
[6/2/17, 10:07:28 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: When we start up right
[6/2/17, 10:07:34 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Ooo
[6/2/17, 10:07:41 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: We have to maintain the advantages of the start up even as we expand
[6/2/17, 10:08:36 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: As in, something like Alphabet. Split your company into the tiniest pieces but under a trustworthy umbrella
[6/2/17, 10:08:56 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Splitting is a complicated decision
[6/2/17, 10:09:12 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: On one level it's a legal issue, and also a branding issue
[6/2/17, 10:09:54 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: If you have spent time, money, and effort to build a brand, it is worth trying to leverage that for future growth, as long as the brand image makes sense
[6/2/17, 10:10:02 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Also logistics
[6/2/17, 10:10:17 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: It sometimes makes a lot of sense to share logistics with one another
[6/2/17, 10:11:02 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: So it's an interesting option, but not something I would do in many scenarios without thinking about it a lot
[6/2/17, 10:21:09 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: But the core of what you're saying is very true - if you can keep the good parts of being a start up, that's great
[6/2/17, 10:22:28 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Sorry for the delay. Koushik was lecturing me about the difficulties as well 😅
[6/2/17, 10:22:42 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Yeah you make a lot of sense
[6/2/17, 10:22:46 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Mmmmm
[6/2/17, 10:25:08 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: What you're talking about is a very real problem. Companies do find it hard to balance efficiency with checks and balances
[6/3/17, 8:15:07 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I think I left my wallet in the escort last night. Who do I contact? Campus police..?
[6/3/17, 8:15:15 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Any particular lost and found it goes to..?
[6/3/17, 8:24:57 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Doesn't each bus have a lost and found bin or something

[6/7/17, 8:09:25 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Haha
[6/8/17, 7:27:11 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Just like the Google assistant is now available as an app for Apple phones,  are there any speakers which let you put any assistant you want on them?
[6/8/17, 7:27:18 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Maybe even multiple assistants?
[6/8/17, 8:27:19 AM] Maitreya Naik: Just to be clear, that would be possible only on existing assistance speakers not any speakers
[6/8/17, 8:28:31 AM] Maitreya Naik: Unless you have a module housing such an assistant with relevant mic arrays and you plug it to any speaker
[6/8/17, 8:28:49 AM] Maitreya Naik: Calibration becomes important in that case
[6/8/17, 8:29:38 AM] Maitreya Naik: Such a module would need to handle calibrating its mic to ignore any kind of speaker noise (electrical or acoustic) especially residues when the speaker is not being utilized by the assistant
[6/8/17, 8:33:42 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Yep it would have to be a speaker which is calibrated for being an assistant (listening plus Internet connection plus maybe processing power)
[6/8/17, 8:34:03 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: There isn't much which stops speaker companies from manufacturing one like it
[6/8/17, 8:46:31 AM] Maitreya Naik: I think this is what stops speaker companies. Not that it is very hard to do. But the initial increased expense and its predicted popularity plays a big role, if you mean speaker companies like Bose
[6/8/17, 8:47:17 AM] Maitreya Naik: Sony could possibly do it because of its breadth of products
[6/8/17, 8:48:05 AM] Maitreya Naik: And its experience with voice controlled devices
[6/8/17, 8:52:49 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: And these kinds of optimizations, are they mainly hardware based or software?
[6/8/17, 9:03:40 AM] Maitreya Naik: It's a new system, right? So it involves placement of the mics in a mic array to cover most of the required region with least overlap to decrease complications on the software. You have to have good firmware timing. Since mostly auditory localization would be necessary to understand where the user is speaking from and whether to increase gain from the mics covering that region
[6/8/17, 9:05:28 AM] Maitreya Naik: Then once a good tuning of the microphone gains is done (depending on the speaker the difficulty varies from "That was too easy" to "Take my soul away from this body"!. Companies would probably prefer to spend more and be in the former of the two positions), you move on to software calibration for both signal processing of ambient noise reduction, speaker noise reduction.  Both these features could be HW implemented or software implemented
[6/8/17, 9:07:09 AM] Maitreya Naik: Once the interference is mildly taken care of, you move on to the pipeline of the interaction with the human voice and the interface with the OS that you prefer your assistant app to be placed on
[6/8/17, 9:07:51 AM] Maitreya Naik: Of course all of these are my rudimentary estimations of the development pipeline. Companies would have more complicated and differently sequenced approaches
[6/8/17, 9:10:25 AM] Maitreya Naik: Although I do believe choosing the hardware should be the first priority since if you don't have appropriate hardware, you don't get your ideal assumptions on the data and then you either spend time taking care of all the filtering and sanitizing till the input fits your software. A good software development would be aware and take care of these cases though
[6/8/17, 9:25:49 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: So I *JUST* realized lion king is based on hamlet. 🙈
[6/8/17, 9:43:20 AM] Abhilasha CMU: No twisted mommy stuff no?
[6/8/17, 9:45:06 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: That sounds like a good pipeline
[6/8/17, 9:47:49 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Scar and Sarabi have stuff happen right? Although yeah, Sarabi remains good.
[6/8/17, 1:08:23 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Koushik is leaving us early tomorrow for quite a few days

[6/12/17, 10:44:10 AM] Koushik Bhavani: 😂😂😂
[6/12/17, 3:18:42 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: ProTip: If you crush doesn't respond to you, he/she probably has message preview on, in that case send them a (some relevant) picture and their curiosity will ensure they open the frickin chat. Tried and tested. If he/she does not reply even after that, we've got news for you. :P

[6/13/17, 9:03:57 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: She talks really well :o
[6/13/17, 10:21:13 PM] Maitreya Naik: What the heck. She is really smart! Although the condescending tone was used a little bit too much by her. But wow, she really thinks she knows what she is talking about. Is this how people see Trump? A child with extreme confidence and vague and only comparatively better ideas for a sixth grader?
[6/14/17, 4:29:59 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Woah were you in it?
[6/14/17, 4:30:12 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: And what's above your room?

[6/14/17, 7:24:47 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Tickets are cheaper and concert will be better 😋😋
[6/14/17, 7:25:46 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Ok. Tickets aren't cheaper 😅
[6/14/17, 7:36:58 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Nah
[6/14/17, 1:35:43 PM] Shrivani CMU: Is anyone interested to go for the US open on labor day weekend?

[6/14/17, 1:42:33 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: They aren't selling tickets for finals yet?
[6/14/17, 1:42:44 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Men's final?
[6/14/17, 1:42:52 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Sept 10th. Can't find anything
[6/14/17, 1:43:25 PM] Prithvi Shankar: September 2nd is Saturday (which is 3rd round)
September 3rd you should go (round of 16)

[6/14/17, 2:49:00 PM] Shrivani CMU: 😳😳 my god
[6/14/17, 2:54:01 PM] Prithvi Shankar: I wonder if @14128167447 caught a glimpse 😛
[6/14/17, 2:54:05 PM] Maitreya Naik: Ye Sharmaji ke ladke. Never have they experienced disappointment. And when they do, they go berserk 😂
[6/14/17, 2:54:18 PM] Maitreya Naik: Hmm
[6/14/17, 3:02:11 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: :/
[6/14/17, 3:20:56 PM] Aum Jadhav: 😂😂😂
[6/14/17, 3:53:34 PM] Shrivani CMU: You also come!
[6/14/17, 4:04:24 PM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: I'll be home at that time :D
[6/14/17, 4:43:32 PM] Shivam Gupta: Guys guys, need that video where I was singing at Thuruk thuruk's place last fall😆
[6/14/17, 4:43:33 PM] Shivam Gupta: Anyone still have it?
[6/14/17, 4:45:02 PM] Prithvi Shankar: 😂
[6/14/17, 4:46:19 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Are you guys hearing about how Trump is now under investigation for obstruction of justice?
[6/14/17, 4:46:42 PM] Shivam Gupta: Yeah
[6/14/17, 4:47:15 PM] Shivam Gupta: Comey revealing the secrets, now that he is fired
[6/14/17, 4:54:40 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: New FBI head is running it apparently
[6/14/17, 4:54:52 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Oh he's called the Special Counsel
[6/14/17, 4:56:58 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: <‎GIF omitted>
[6/14/17, 5:02:19 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Haha I hope he tries
[6/14/17, 5:04:37 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: I might :
[6/14/17, 5:04:54 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: If not, it was on Noopsie's phone
[6/14/17, 5:05:23 PM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: It was?
[6/14/17, 5:05:24 PM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: 😅
[6/14/17, 5:05:35 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber
[6/14/17, 5:06:24 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Wait, was that at Noopsie's house? 🤔
[6/14/17, 5:06:38 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: I have one of you singing in Shreyas' house
[6/14/17, 5:08:26 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Uber has been in a number of mess ups. Since that story was published, they appointed an 'independent' committee
[6/14/17, 5:08:33 PM] Shivam Gupta: Wait what 😂😂
[6/14/17, 5:09:35 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: It's members were Arianna Huffington  (one of their board members), an HR member (the HR department was one of the principal ones under investigation ), and members of a law firm who count Uber as their clients
[6/14/17, 5:09:57 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: <‎video omitted>
[6/14/17, 5:10:34 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: And now I believe the board has asked the number 2 at Uber to step down entirely and Travis Kalanick is taking a leave of absence or something
[6/14/17, 5:11:22 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I heard about Kalanick
[6/14/17, 5:11:38 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Didn't quite know about the rest of this shitstorm.
[6/14/17, 5:12:34 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Oh there have been a bunch of incidents since as well. Kalanick yelling at one of the Uber drivers,  Kalanick advising employees about having sex over some sort of company retreat
[6/14/17, 5:13:01 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: As in, after the Susan Fowler incident and before he took  the leave
[6/14/17, 5:13:20 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Oh boy
[6/14/17, 5:14:40 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Also Google (waymo) suing them for stealing secrets. They day that a guy who went from Waymo to Uber was telling them about Google self-driving algorithm
[6/14/17, 5:16:25 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/06/14/uber_waymo_legal_battle_latest/ ?
[6/14/17, 5:39:42 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I'm not only ripping on Uber (though I do think they have a serious problem). Susan Fowler's is far from an isolated experience http://observer.com/2017/02/uber-sexual-harrasment-susan-fowler/
[6/14/17, 6:04:15 PM] Shivam Gupta: Thanks!!
[6/14/17, 7:04:35 PM] Aum Jadhav: I could bite the bullet here if you like, given that I've been following this for a while and am now privy to much more information as an employee. I don't think too many people care for the spam though...
[6/14/17, 7:10:34 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Me tooooooo!
[6/14/17, 7:23:52 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Oo go for it
[6/14/17, 7:50:00 PM] Aum Jadhav: I’ve learnt more about all these cases in 2 weeks than I have in 6 months of following the news. Note that I’ve been here just for a few weeks, so don’t have any strong bias yet.
[6/14/17, 7:50:04 PM] Aum Jadhav: Re: Susan Fowler Case - It’s unfortunate and absolutely deplorable, zero doubt. But it isn’t just a product of Uber’s (mis)management. Rather it’s a symptom of the pervasive sexism and misogyny that has long plagued tech in general, and The Valley in particular.
[6/14/17, 7:50:21 PM] Aum Jadhav: Everyone, including C-levels were appalled when the story first came up. And there has been a genuine, concerted effort on their part to correct it.  The “independent” committee off board member is so-called because they have no conflict of interests with anyone in the senior management, and have the authority to roll any head they like.
[6/14/17, 7:50:39 PM] Aum Jadhav: There have been investigations by two independent law firms since. One to probe, legally, into all the individual cases of this sort, resulting in tens of people being fired, and more severely reprimanded. Second, headed by former Attorney General Eric Holder, seeks to make recommendations regarding high-level management and company culture. Both of these have resulted, in an insane amount of measures to improve employee relations - 24/7 hotlines, therapy, change in perfs, etc being some of them.
[6/14/17, 7:51:39 PM] Aum Jadhav: As for the CEO himself, his biggest mistake has been acting as a typical “Startup CEO” for too long. The culture of hustle and jugaad doesn’t bode well for MNC with thousands of employees. And about the sex advice thing, it was clearly a joke. He was only talking about consent and conflict of interest, it wasn't even inappropriate.
[6/14/17, 7:52:15 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Oh nice, what are some of these efforts? And doesn't the HR person report to the management, and doesn't the law firm fear losing a huge and important client?
[6/14/17, 7:52:50 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I'm impressed, especially with the firing
[6/14/17, 7:54:03 PM] Aum Jadhav: They've rehauled the hierarchy. Complaints of this sort are no longer subject to bureaucracy. In fact, there is an entirely new division dedicated to diversity and inclusion now.
[6/14/17, 7:54:25 PM] Aum Jadhav: There probably is a culture issue, but from what I see they are working really hard to do all they can. Uber has had a horrible year PR wise, and clickbait media trials have only made it look worse than what it really is.
[6/14/17, 7:58:07 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Hmm I see what you're saying about the email, but I'm not sure i completely agree about the propriety of it. In the sense that, the two lines about sex, if taken out of context, were definitely very sensible. However, it does feel like it was a bit frat bro-ish. At the same time I know that this is subjective. I wonder what female Uber employees felt about it
[6/14/17, 7:58:18 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: And it's great that they're going through the re-haul
[6/14/17, 7:58:29 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: i hope they manage to get a culture shift in place :]
[6/14/17, 7:58:57 PM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: Guys please pm
[6/14/17, 7:59:04 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Haha okay
[6/14/17, 8:00:16 PM] Aum Jadhav: lol

LOL
[7/11/17, 4:54:04 AM] Abhilasha CMU: 4. Is the list of colleges same for both males and females?

No, the list is marginally relaxed for females. Most premier colleges have more than double the number of females and sometimes male to female ratio at premier institutions is 5:1. For Females, we have also included a select list of graduation colleges on all India basis. (Note: See Others under Indian and city)
[7/11/17, 5:10:08 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Oh wow
[7/11/17, 12:15:29 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Does anyone know of an easy easy way to make a custom Alexa skill? I have my dialogue thought out. Is there anything into which I can just put that?

[7/11/17, 12:34:13 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I can connect you with people who made the Alexa game etc project if you want.
[7/11/17, 12:35:58 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Thank you, I'll tell you if I need it!
[7/11/17, 12:36:04 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I'll try on my own a bit
[7/11/17, 12:36:13 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: It shouldn't be this convoluted
[7/11/17, 12:40:22 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Haha one of my seniors made a visual node editor in unity for writing Alexa skills.
[7/11/17, 12:40:39 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It is kinda convoluted
[7/11/17, 12:43:45 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Haha I don't know what a visual node editor is either!
[7/11/17, 1:21:05 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Turns out there is a Skill Builder Beta 🤓🤓🤓
[7/11/17, 1:21:08 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I'm trying it out
[7/11/17, 1:28:24 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Basically a flowchart which you edit to make the program. As in, no code required.
[7/11/17, 1:28:48 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Lemme know how it goes
[7/11/17, 1:34:21 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: That sounds excellent

[7/12/17, 10:26:24 AM] Shrivani CMU: 😅
[7/12/17, 10:27:22 AM] Prithvi Shankar: yeahh :-O
[7/12/17, 10:27:42 AM] Shrivani CMU: Berdych is a touch opponent though
[7/12/17, 10:27:52 AM] Shrivani CMU: Fed has lost to him in his best form too
[7/12/17, 10:27:56 AM] Prithvi Shankar: That forehand pass 🙏🏽
[7/12/17, 10:28:10 AM] Prithvi Shankar: But Berdych was at his best then. He's not now
[7/12/17, 10:28:33 AM] Shrivani CMU: Yeah, possible
[7/12/17, 10:28:34 AM] Prithvi Shankar: He couldn't break Djokovic's serve even though he was serving less than 100 mph
[7/12/17, 10:28:41 AM] Shrivani CMU: Ohkk
[7/12/17, 10:28:49 AM] Shrivani CMU: Go Fed!! 😁😁
[7/12/17, 10:29:04 AM] Prithvi Shankar: He broke it in the second set but Djokovic was ready to retire by then
[7/12/17, 10:29:08 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Yeaahhh
[7/12/17, 1:32:57 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Guys, in case you didn't read the email from the GSA, they're selling tickets to Sandcastle and Kennywood for $10 and $15 respectively, which is really cheap
[7/12/17, 1:33:03 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: They're valid until September
[7/12/17, 1:33:39 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: If you want tickets, send me a photo of your ID and Venmo me. I'll try getting them for you
[7/12/17, 1:33:42 PM] Prithvi Shankar: They're valid only on certain dates I heard
[7/12/17, 1:33:59 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: No, they're valid on all days up to sme date in September

[7/13/17, 6:42:38 AM] Shivam Gupta: Woah
[7/13/17, 6:49:44 AM] Michael RI: Wouldn't it have been appropriate to pick a replacement before leaving?
[7/13/17, 6:50:58 AM] Shruti Rijhwani: There's an interim president.
[7/13/17, 6:54:54 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: That's part of the message Michael
[7/13/17, 6:55:40 AM] Michael RI: which they didn't even have before he announced

[7/15/17, 12:20:57 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Question for the gamers here:
What would you prefer? 
1. First person shooter gameplay
2. Third person shooter gameplay
3. Gameplay where you're controlling another person to do all the attacking but this other person knows of your existence and keeps looking at you through the screen and it's kinda first person that way? (I wanna say second person shooter lol)
[7/15/17, 12:21:28 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: (assume that 3 has a reason that's explained in the story)
[7/15/17, 12:25:57 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: 3 sounds awesome
[7/15/17, 12:27:12 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Haha so you'd pick 3 over the other 2?
[7/15/17, 12:47:42 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Do you mean the character you control is facing you?
[7/15/17, 12:48:32 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Not always, but yes, from time to time
[7/15/17, 12:48:47 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Kinda like a 'what do I do next?'
[7/15/17, 12:49:22 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Is it going to be like when Harry plays with a borrowed chess set, where the pieces keep telling him what to do? :P
[7/15/17, 12:49:38 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Oh, okay
[7/15/17, 12:50:04 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Haha it's more like a Pokemon battle
[7/15/17, 12:51:47 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: You should do this ^, when players are playing in easy mode and are about to make bad moves
[7/15/17, 12:53:26 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: I never liked 2
[7/15/17, 12:53:42 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Not for shooters.
[7/15/17, 12:53:52 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: That's true
[7/15/17, 12:54:19 PM] Shrivani CMU: <‎video omitted>
[7/15/17, 12:54:23 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Maybe for RPGs 2 might be good
[7/15/17, 12:55:01 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Cool. What if it is an RPG
[7/15/17, 12:55:44 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Can you offer a choice to the player?
[7/15/17, 12:55:53 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Like in driving games
[7/15/17, 12:56:11 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: What kinda choice?
[7/15/17, 12:56:26 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: To shift between 1 and 2
[7/15/17, 12:57:55 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Oh
[7/15/17, 12:57:56 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Hm
[7/15/17, 12:58:15 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I think design decisions need to be made with one or the other in mind
[7/15/17, 12:58:31 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Wait.. But isn't 3 a 2++?
[7/15/17, 12:58:36 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It is
[7/15/17, 12:58:38 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Haha
[7/15/17, 12:58:43 PM] Shivam Gupta: This is nice! I knew this.
[7/15/17, 12:59:19 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Then try 3.
[7/15/17, 12:59:29 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Thing is, I've never seen a game like 3.
[7/15/17, 1:00:03 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Gold.
[7/15/17, 1:00:03 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Our round 4 bvw game was kinda like 3
[7/15/17, 1:01:25 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: 3 would be like playing Navi
[7/15/17, 1:04:07 PM] Maitreya Naik: 1
For shooters, 3 would be too complicated
[7/15/17, 1:04:12 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Hm I haven't played Navi
[7/15/17, 1:04:24 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: What if it's an RPG?
[7/15/17, 1:04:29 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: It was good until the final dialogue 😒
[7/15/17, 1:04:30 PM] Maitreya Naik: RPG, 3 is better than 2 depending on the plot
[7/15/17, 1:04:42 PM] Maitreya Naik: The plot has to be good to support it. So dialogue matters
[7/15/17, 1:04:49 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I guess that answers Sanjay's time conundrum
[7/15/17, 1:06:05 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Okay
[7/15/17, 1:06:13 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Thanks for your answers!

[7/17/17, 2:40:39 PM] Sid Dalmia CMU: Fed is 0 for students in f1 visa
[7/17/17, 2:40:40 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Only some companies don't deduct federal tax. Most do.
[7/17/17, 2:40:55 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: We'll get it back when we file for returns.
[7/17/17, 2:40:57 PM] Sid Dalmia CMU: Ya they will deduct you get all of it back
[7/17/17, 2:41:47 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: This is only for PA.

[7/17/17, 3:22:41 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Weren't you supposed to come here sometime?
[7/17/17, 3:23:15 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: yeah, deepak came here instead, so probably not happening.

[7/18/17, 7:26:57 AM] Maitreya Naik: Or some animal just brought it after hitting it
[7/18/17, 7:27:35 AM] Shruti Rijhwani: It's way inside. The back stairs between mine and Kou/Gau/Sanj house
[7/18/17, 7:27:40 AM] Shruti Rijhwani: No idea how it would get here
[7/18/17, 7:27:49 AM] Shruti Rijhwani: I think it was Avk.
[7/18/17, 7:27:51 AM] Maitreya Naik: Tch. Could have been trapped too.
[7/18/17, 7:27:59 AM] Maitreya Naik: I support this motion
[7/18/17, 7:28:40 AM] Shruti Rijhwani: The number of these around wendover has sharply increased after he moved here.
[7/18/17, 7:28:53 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Is it dead? If not then no way it's me
[7/18/17, 7:29:06 AM] Shruti Rijhwani: Yes it is dead.
[7/18/17, 7:29:10 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Oops
[7/18/17, 7:43:12 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: All these deaths around wendover began after I moved

[7/18/17, 1:14:36 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: How did you people figure out what taxes you're supposed to be paying?
[7/18/17, 1:15:12 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I started getting charged so I asked HR to stop charging me and they did. But now I'm not sure if I'm supposed to pay or not
[7/18/17, 1:22:09 PM] Prithvi Shankar: Whatever happens, you'll receive the right amount of money if you file your taxes properly in March
[7/18/17, 1:24:39 PM] Prithvi Shankar: I think the most common case among interns is that both federal and state taxes are being cut with tax filing status as S1/S0
[7/18/17, 1:43:49 PM] Maitreya Naik: OIE had a page which mentioned that we are not meant to pay OASDI and Medicare. Maybe a Google search would help.
But for the forms had to do a lot of IRS publication lookups
[7/18/17, 1:44:32 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Yeah, we don't
[7/18/17, 1:44:47 PM] Maitreya Naik: Especially because of a treaty with India which gives an extra withholding to Indian students and business people
[7/18/17, 1:45:20 PM] Maitreya Naik: I'm answering the "How"
I know we don't
[7/18/17, 1:45:53 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Oh alright. Just confirming :)
[7/18/17, 1:47:03 PM] Maitreya Naik: 👍🏼
[7/18/17, 1:47:57 PM] Maitreya Naik: Sorry. Code review making me write short sentences. XD
[7/18/17, 2:25:03 PM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: Convenient :P
[7/18/17, 2:26:00 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Wait, you just asked HR to stop charging you taxes and they listened to you??
[7/18/17, 3:36:46 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Haha seems like it
[7/18/17, 3:37:08 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I don't want to be penalised when I file taxes so I'm looking into it now!
[7/18/17, 4:28:01 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Do you know where I can buy Allen keys in squirrel hill?

[7/19/17, 8:49:09 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: But this seems so pointless
[7/19/17, 8:49:24 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I'm baffled by it
[7/19/17, 8:50:57 AM] Maitreya Naik: Haha. At first glance, seems like a promo event for the creator. Need to dig a bit into it though.
[7/19/17, 8:56:11 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: What's there to dig into?
[7/19/17, 8:56:23 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Can you do anything but press the start button?

^Answer.
Apparently some people got sick in a Virgina branch. Already suffering from the aversion from the August 2015 E coli outbreak, even one restaurant causing problems would trigger Chipotle to highlight how simple their menu is and appreciate the removal of preservatives that they have always pushed for
[7/19/17, 9:08:39 AM] Maitreya Naik: I like the audio snippets that have been attached to some ingredients. Couldn't properly distinguish all of them.
The shake of the salad,
The hollow tap on the bowl
[7/19/17, 9:08:48 AM] Maitreya Naik: *for the bowl
[7/19/17, 9:11:36 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: What even is this

[7/20/17, 11:25:18 AM] Prithvi Shankar: True I guess
[7/20/17, 11:26:25 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Damn 😪
[7/20/17, 11:26:33 AM] Maitreya Naik: What's worse is the article mentions hits from 7 years and more ago. Which might say something about the lack of crowd toward their newer songs, which wouldn't have been very encouraging to think about either
[7/20/17, 11:27:27 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Every band/singer has their golden Era man. But this is such a bad decision
[7/20/17, 11:28:02 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Paul McCartney has no notable songs after 1970s. He's still alive.
[7/20/17, 11:32:17 AM] Maitreya Naik: Everyone has their own thoughts. You are comparing something that happened after a group split
[7/20/17, 11:32:22 AM] Maitreya Naik: Which is not great either
[7/20/17, 11:51:55 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: :(

[8/1/17, 3:08:20 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Listen!
[8/1/17, 3:08:55 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I just got a job offer from UW, the usual RA position offer from my prof. The pay is insane!
[8/1/17, 3:09:21 PM] Prithvi Shankar: Congrats da
[8/1/17, 3:09:30 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: 40$ an hour. Minimum working hours per week 40. That makes it 6400$ a month!
[8/1/17, 3:09:31 PM] Prithvi Shankar: 😁
[8/1/17, 3:09:36 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I used to get 2300$ here!
[8/1/17, 3:09:40 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: 😅
[8/1/17, 3:10:01 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Life is going to be so amazing so soon haha
[8/1/17, 3:10:43 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Congrats! :D
[8/1/17, 3:10:53 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Thanks :D
[8/1/17, 3:11:03 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Was it $2300 for 40hs?
[8/1/17, 3:11:16 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: 40hs is.. Full time
[8/1/17, 3:11:24 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: It was 2300$ for 20hours
[8/1/17, 3:11:42 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Fuck you dude..you just spoilt everything
[8/1/17, 3:11:44 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Dammit
[8/1/17, 3:11:54 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: No haha I'm realist
[8/1/17, 3:11:55 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Not much of a difference then
[8/1/17, 3:11:56 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: :|
[8/1/17, 3:11:59 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: It's still much better
[8/1/17, 3:12:01 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I was so happy
[8/1/17, 3:12:19 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Isn't it 50% more?
[8/1/17, 3:12:39 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Are you paid extra for extra hours over 40?
[8/1/17, 3:12:58 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Yeah I am
[8/1/17, 3:13:04 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: 1.5 times the usual amount
[8/1/17, 3:13:11 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: For extra hours
[8/1/17, 3:13:23 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: You wouldn't if the offer was only 20 hours
[8/1/17, 3:13:38 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Hour n°21 is not paid extra
[8/1/17, 3:13:45 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: So that's good for you
[8/1/17, 3:13:58 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Also, who's checking your time?
[8/1/17, 3:14:01 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Sid?
[8/1/17, 3:14:04 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: We have to log it
[8/1/17, 3:14:28 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I am not sure who checks it but I have to log my work times somewhere
[8/1/17, 3:15:00 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: What about classes?
[8/1/17, 3:15:11 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Is that in addition to the 40 hs of work?
[8/1/17, 3:16:11 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: 40 hours a week is insane though. You'll also have classes and have to work on your thesis right? :P
[8/1/17, 3:16:42 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Well RA and thesis should go hand in hand. Otherwise yeah, it's insane
[8/1/17, 3:17:08 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: And PhD students here have to teach compulsorily I think. So if you're also doing that...
[8/1/17, 3:18:02 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Oh a PhD student I was working with was always complaining about how he had to work for his lab and didn't have enough time to put in towards his own thesis :P
[8/1/17, 3:19:05 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Man, that's slavery. Well not if the PhD accepted it. That's just having no convictions.
[8/1/17, 3:19:41 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: I mean, if you complain about it that is. If you like it then do it.
[8/1/17, 3:20:04 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: @14129615683 I said this because I realized this 40hrs thing would be 20 once classes start so..umm
[8/1/17, 3:20:32 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: :|
[8/1/17, 3:20:36 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: 20hs at $3200?
[8/1/17, 3:20:54 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Yeah I guess those would be the numbers during the wuarter yeah
[8/1/17, 3:21:00 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: quarter*
[8/1/17, 3:21:11 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: That's still, 40% higher than here
[8/1/17, 3:21:28 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: No. RI PhDs here get 3200$
[8/1/17, 3:21:37 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: I think sometimes you don't have a choice if your lab funds your PhD program :/
[8/1/17, 3:21:45 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: So in an expensive city like Seattle I am going to get fucked relative to people in Pitts
[8/1/17, 3:21:51 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: :P
[8/1/17, 3:22:05 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Well, when you pick your program, you pick the whole package. No one forces you.
[8/1/17, 3:22:22 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: 😅
[8/1/17, 3:22:38 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Yeah, that's true 😅
[8/1/17, 3:22:49 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: After the first 2 years I think you write your own grants in the field you love to pursue research in. I guess that makes life easier..?
[8/1/17, 3:23:08 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: After the first two years of PhD?
[8/1/17, 3:23:22 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Yeah, so once they're done teasing you 😂
[8/1/17, 3:23:38 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Yeah. At least in UW the first 2 years the school funds us. Other places it might be more or less than that
[8/1/17, 3:25:16 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Anyway, sorry to burst your bubble. Better now than after you've used your credit card with money you don't have.
[8/1/17, 3:27:19 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Thanks for saving me from being broke :')
[8/1/17, 3:40:38 PM] Maitreya Naik: 😂 This exchange

[8/3/17, 4:38:34 PM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: Companies pay 1300$ to be a part of TOC 😲
[8/3/17, 4:38:41 PM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: Did you guys know that?
[8/3/17, 4:39:50 PM] Prithvi Shankar: Yup
[8/3/17, 4:40:24 PM] Prithvi Shankar: You just googled toc didn't you?
[8/3/17, 4:41:13 PM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: No, someone told me
[8/3/17, 4:48:50 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: $1300.. The ToC brings companies much more candidates than a HR headhunting company could do for just $1300.
[8/3/17, 4:49:11 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: I'm surprise it is that cheap.
[8/3/17, 4:49:17 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Surprised *
[8/3/17, 4:49:56 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Yeah it is so cheap that it makes one think why CMU is even charging them if its that low
[8/3/17, 4:50:02 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Yeah, I am too...
[8/3/17, 4:50:15 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Its not like 1300 from every company is going to make them a lot richer :|
[8/3/17, 4:50:14 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Is it $1300 per student they recruit?
[8/3/17, 4:50:27 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Or $1300 per hour? :P
[8/3/17, 4:51:48 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: It's not even a barrier for companies that won't take it seriously.
[8/3/17, 4:52:15 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: I doubt it's that. It probably cuts down the number of companies that attend.
And also so companies don't take booths on all days. Stuff like that I think
[8/3/17, 4:52:43 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: 😂

[8/4/17, 8:36:00 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: Just remember you'll have to wait more than 7 days for the next one. And I hear this episode's crazy and ends on a real cliffhanger :P
[8/4/17, 8:38:03 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Moot point. Just remember that it doesn't matter because relatively you'll be in a worse situation when he spoils it for you. You'd miss knowing the cliffhanger in a legit way and would have to wait for more than seven days to get back at him. :P
[8/4/17, 8:38:42 AM] Koushik Bhavani: Thanks avk 😂
[8/4/17, 8:38:45 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: But he won't spoil so..

[8/4/17, 8:58:00 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Moo* point
[8/4/17, 9:14:42 AM] Michael RI: Watch google drive purged its servers of all copies of this
[8/4/17, 9:15:13 AM] Michael RI: But... plot twist... HBO uses google drive and their copies get deleted too. The episode is lost forever

[8/8/17, 7:54:21 AM] Prithvi Shankar: People, friend needs help with a project of his. If you have access to Linux machine, can you run the command 'df -h' and send me a screenshot? Don't worry, it just gives the disk usage 😛 Thanks.
[8/10/17, 1:41:04 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: This is going to be lame but I a gonna risk it haha
[8/10/17, 1:41:59 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: AVK, how very fortunate..!

He shivers slightly. Sitting right next to the air conditioner, it _is_ uncomfortably cold. Is it the cold that made him shiver though? Huh. The clock is ticking - heck of a lullaby, his eyes drooping, but the flies(?!) don't let him sleep anyway. He sighs, relieved, he cannot afford to sleep. One more hour and he would need to leave. For good this time. Alone he sits, looking at his watch and wonders how time just...flew. 

It was just over a year, he was jumping with joy looking at his admit letter! CMU was a frickin dream since the first year of his undergrad. And he was finally going to attend the place! The best school for Robotics!

And here he is, a year later. 

He is going to miss CMU. A lot. 

But CMU wasn't Robotics, wasn't the courses he took, wasn't the research he did. CMU was his friends. And when he misses CMU, it's them he shall miss. Very dearly. When he was with them, he didn't have to pur up a show to appear more social, he didn't have to make an effort to converse, he was with his kind of people. All good at heart, helpful, kind and just the loveliest people he could ask for. They made life look so easy! 

He pulls his cellphone up and looks at all the names on his list. He shivers. "Ah, I am sure it's just the cold". He scrolls trying to remember every first meeting. Some of them though! Shivam. Cannot believe it was DECEMBER that they met. That late in life and yet such good friends! Poojita. As late as in December again during the dance practice for Akanksha's birthday. And yet, such good friends..! 

The best thing that happened in life was not CMU, but what happened AT CMU.., Funday Sunday :)

He shivers yet again. "Guess it wasn't the cold after all". He smiles, satisfied. They will be missed. But they are not just friends, they are like family. And family always gets back together. Some day. One day. 

He has few minutes to spare. He stares at the screen and a minute later begins to type furiously into his phone, 
"AVK, how very fortunate..!"
[8/10/17, 1:42:42 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I love you all so much! Goodbye! ❤️
[8/10/17, 1:45:51 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Keep in touch please 😅
[8/10/17, 1:58:01 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Damn man
[8/10/17, 1:59:22 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: The one thing I know is that if you're in the USA, we'll surely keep meeting. I know this won't be enough, but we have that much at least. Don't give up any opportunities to come meet us! Goodluck with everything!
[8/10/17, 2:04:14 AM] Prithvi Shankar: You shall be missed da. Bye bye.

[8/18/17, 8:01:44 AM] Koushik Bhavani: Anger
[8/18/17, 8:01:54 AM] Koushik Bhavani: Then they serve food so late
[8/18/17, 8:02:01 AM] Koushik Bhavani: You'll die if you ever go hungry
[8/18/17, 8:02:07 AM] Koushik Bhavani: You should have one meal then go
[8/18/17, 8:02:50 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: But the food tastes so good
[8/18/17, 8:04:21 AM] Koushik Bhavani: Last time me avk and Sanju ordered something the waiter thought she'll save us money supposedly and changed the order 😑

[8/18/17, 4:33:05 PM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: 😂😂😂
[8/18/17, 4:33:45 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Oh right!
[8/18/17, 4:33:56 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Yes yes now I remember 😂
[8/18/17, 5:13:00 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: <‎image omitted>
[8/18/17, 5:13:03 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Guys
[8/18/17, 5:13:08 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Who had what last night?
[8/18/17, 5:22:29 PM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: 3 JD and 1 fireball
[8/18/17, 5:24:25 PM] Deepak Gopinath CMU: 😮
[8/18/17, 5:37:08 PM] Koushik Bhavani: He didn't I did 😋
[8/18/17, 5:43:00 PM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: Abhijeet had 3 JDs 1 yinz and 1 fireball
[8/18/17, 6:22:51 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: 🙃
[8/18/17, 6:39:41 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: I had 1 yinz, 1 JD and 1 fireball? Wait that seems too little for the state I was in 🤔
[8/18/17, 7:42:24 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Did you also have a JD shot?
[8/18/17, 7:43:13 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: No, I think the JDs add up
[8/18/17, 7:43:35 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Did Koushik have a fireball?
[8/18/17, 7:46:38 PM] Shivam Gupta: 😂😂😂
[8/18/17, 7:54:23 PM] Koushik Bhavani: No don't think so 😂
[8/18/17, 8:02:18 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Drank so much you ended up in Nevada ?
[8/18/17, 8:32:38 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Haha I drank so much I forgot where I put my umbrella :P
[8/18/17, 8:35:09 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Trust me, the two are not related
[8/18/17, 8:38:11 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: 😂
[8/18/17, 8:40:36 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: 😂😂😂
[8/18/17, 8:58:17 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: <‎image omitted>
[8/18/17, 8:58:41 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Does this mean I have to pay 2350$ or has it been taken care of?
[8/18/17, 8:59:08 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: There's a plus minus 2309$ which I don't understand
[8/18/17, 9:17:32 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: The +- 2039 is coz the 2039 should be covered in the previous month's invoice.
[8/18/17, 9:17:59 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Basically they charged you for it already, and then when you actually incurred the expense, they charged you again and then refunded it
[8/18/17, 9:18:09 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: (I may be wrong but I think this is it)
[8/18/17, 9:18:57 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: But your current account balance is 2349 (I think you should check the previous month's invoice to confirm)
[8/18/17, 9:19:43 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Once you pay it, it should be deducted in the 'current Balance' place. There'll be a -2349 in red there and your current balance will be 0.
[8/18/17, 9:29:52 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I checked the previous invoice, you are right! Thanks a lot, makes sense now :)
[8/18/17, 9:33:35 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: 👍🏻

[8/23/17, 10:05:31 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Really random train of thought - 
So I used to think that the world can't possibly be a simulation coz we're experiencing it at far too high a frame rate and I just felt that the cpu/GPU power required for that was more than I could imagine. 
(A stupid argument, but one that had my brain satisfied)
But I just realised this argument itself fails on other grounds as well - we won't know if there is frame lag, coz we're being simulated. To us, the frame rate is a constant. 

Right?
[8/23/17, 10:06:12 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Feel free to ignore, I'm just thinking out loud (on text)
[8/23/17, 10:08:42 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: You know sometimes when you're sitting in class and you check your watch after an hour and it's only been five minutes? Maybe that's frame lag :P
[8/23/17, 10:09:07 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Hah that's interesting
[8/23/17, 10:09:47 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: But that means you as an entity don't freeze, but time does. Frame lag would essentially be equivalent to time stopping and everyone else stopping with it.
[8/23/17, 10:10:23 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: At least, I think that's what it would be. Coz the cpu/GPU stall while waiting for the current cycle to finish
[8/23/17, 10:10:32 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: I was just kidding :)
[8/23/17, 10:10:35 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Frame *
[8/23/17, 10:10:58 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Haha given the weird nature of this train of thought, I took you seriously
[8/23/17, 10:11:18 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Frame lag from the perspective of entities in the simulation shouldn't be noticeable, the way I see it
[8/23/17, 10:11:27 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Exactly
[8/23/17, 10:11:39 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: That's what I just realised
[8/23/17, 11:27:56 AM] Maitreya Naik: Yes
[8/23/17, 11:30:29 AM] Maitreya Naik: Also we don't know the magnitude of the resources required to run the simulation. We are also unaware of them. You assume that a technology exactly relying on CPU and GPU is being used which work on clocks and are linear in time. It could be the case that time is also a non-unidirectional dimension for the simulating "machine". Meaning that what we call frame rate may be irrelevant as a context for analysing the machine's full capabilities
[8/23/17, 11:30:56 AM] Maitreya Naik: ~linear in time~
[8/23/17, 12:28:47 PM] Koushik Bhavani: Basketball today ?
[8/23/17, 12:29:17 PM] Maitreya Naik: Are we doing something tonight?
[8/23/17, 12:29:22 PM] Maitreya Naik: Yoga is also interested
[8/23/17, 12:29:44 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Who is yoga
[8/23/17, 12:31:22 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Yoga is an art
[8/23/17, 12:42:13 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Hence 'stupid assumption'.
[8/23/17, 12:42:44 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: *argument
[8/23/17, 1:32:09 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: If you knew this was a simulation, would you want to wake up?
[8/23/17, 1:32:31 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Not yet! :D
[8/23/17, 1:40:24 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Haha why not?
[8/23/17, 1:40:29 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: And when would you want to?
[8/23/17, 1:42:34 PM] Maitreya Naik: You don't exist. You are a simulation yourself. Just temporary data moving from register to register, adding and subtracting information
[8/23/17, 1:42:55 PM] Maitreya Naik: So make the collection real good
[8/23/17, 1:47:06 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Not necessarily. I'm talking about a Matrix-like scenario
[8/23/17, 1:48:29 PM] Maitreya Naik: Ah. Well it's a risk worth taking. I think the limiting factor would be the physical restraints that you may wake up in.
[8/23/17, 1:49:05 PM] Maitreya Naik: If your body is not used to being used, then you will wake up in a very weak state to try and escape
[8/23/17, 1:50:12 PM] Maitreya Naik: But it comes down to whether you want to attempt finding out the truth of existence or spend more leisure time. I would love to wake up and attempt a fight and pursuit through it all
[8/23/17, 1:54:54 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I like it here. 
If it was all a simulation and I don't actually exist, I'd want it to end. (not the same as me waking up) 
If I do actually exist and right now, an avatar of me in the simulation is typing this text, then no, I don't want to wake up. Not right now. Probably never. Too many memories have been made, good and bad. And it would suck for them to not mean anything.
[8/23/17, 2:02:06 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Hmm I was talking about Matrix to the extent of having a physical body. Imagine a far more benign scenario apart from that. Nobody is forcing you into the simulation, and you don't really need to escape
[8/23/17, 2:02:22 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: If you want to get out of the simulation, Aditi, you'd want to take everyone along with you, no? *cough* bomb the frickin planet to wake everyone up? *cough*
[8/23/17, 2:02:44 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Haha don't project your wished onto me :P
[8/23/17, 2:03:01 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: *wishes
[8/23/17, 2:03:07 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I wouldn't think twice if I were convinced 😛
[8/23/17, 2:07:15 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Haha what would you need to be convinced of? Just that it's a simulation?
[8/23/17, 2:10:45 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Yeah
[8/23/17, 2:12:42 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Probably isn't. Not one person has superpowers! But the worlds we create do? The ones running us would be so boring? Nah. Hence not a simulated world. Me thinks. 😋
[8/23/17, 2:14:58 PM] Maitreya Naik: I think super powers are a matter of perspective
[8/23/17, 2:15:27 PM] Maitreya Naik: Could be that our conscience is a superpower that guides us into moral actions that we define by our experiences
[8/23/17, 2:15:43 PM] Maitreya Naik: A conscience may not exist for other creatures
[8/23/17, 2:15:58 PM] Maitreya Naik: We are Giants to insects
[8/23/17, 2:16:07 PM] Maitreya Naik: And miniatures to elephants
[8/23/17, 2:16:32 PM] Maitreya Naik: They may think we have superpowers if they could think of such an abstract construct
[8/23/17, 2:18:47 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Hmm superpowers are mostly abnormal powers. The things that are normal don't feel like superpowers. Maybe the simulators just want more uniformity between people's characteristics in this world?
[8/23/17, 2:21:54 PM] Maitreya Naik: Yupp. Everything is relative. Maybe the simulation also intended to have a sufficient number of beings with what they would define as "super" powers. But merely population led them to be considered normal and not abnormal
[8/23/17, 2:21:56 PM] Maitreya Naik: Anyway
[8/23/17, 2:24:47 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Because the simulation is at a really good phase now! :D
[8/23/17, 2:25:02 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: And I'm curious to see where things go
[8/23/17, 2:25:27 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Just see, or experience also?
[8/23/17, 2:25:39 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: What if you could get out but continue to see things?
[8/23/17, 2:27:04 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Mmm
[8/23/17, 2:27:43 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: You're right, I want to experience it
[8/23/17, 4:02:36 PM] Shivam Gupta: Yes😝
[8/23/17, 4:06:09 PM] Maitreya Naik: What are we doing tonight?
[8/23/17, 4:06:31 PM] Shivam Gupta: Basketball
[8/23/17, 4:07:17 PM] Maitreya Naik: Who's in for dinner?
[8/23/17, 4:09:22 PM] Maitreya Naik: Or watch atomic blonde?
[8/23/17, 4:11:38 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Mineo's, 8:30 - 9
[8/23/17, 4:17:10 PM] Maitreya Naik: Whaaat
[8/23/17, 4:17:25 PM] Maitreya Naik: What after? Board games? Movie?
[8/23/17, 4:17:38 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Sleep? :P
[8/23/17, 7:00:50 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It's overrated man :/ I was so disappointed
[8/23/17, 7:01:45 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: What are your answers to all your own questions?
[8/23/17, 7:04:49 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: There's one scene which was awesome but that's it.
[8/23/17, 8:43:22 PM] Maitreya Naik: Oh. I heard that it was good
[8/23/17, 8:43:33 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Same. Idk, you might like it
[8/23/17, 8:43:55 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Personally, baby driver eclipses every other movie I've watched in recent times.
[8/23/17, 9:11:46 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: You haven't watched AnandoBrahma. Telugu movie. Best best besttttt
[8/23/17, 9:12:13 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I was laughing so much my stomach was hurting :D
[8/23/17, 9:47:32 PM] Koushik Bhavani: 😂
[8/24/17, 12:27:02 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Hi anyone up for dinner tonight?  Around 8.30?
[8/24/17, 12:27:48 PM] Shivam Gupta: Drink + dinner✋🏼
[8/24/17, 12:28:49 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Yes. Anywhere with alcohol. Open to suggestions.
[8/24/17, 12:29:24 PM] Maitreya Naik: Yes
[8/24/17, 12:31:16 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Awesome! Any suggestions? We can even go somewhere far away ish like Strip or Downtown if there's any place people want to try!
[8/24/17, 12:32:36 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Or squirrel hill because you know, convenience :P
[8/24/17, 12:33:24 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Gaucho? 😍
[8/24/17, 12:33:42 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Yessss! It's BYOB.
[8/24/17, 12:34:41 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Isn't it like super expensive?
[8/24/17, 12:35:30 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: I think it's like $15 a plate or something. So a little on the higher side, but not terribly.
[8/24/17, 12:35:58 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Ooh that's not too much, nice
[8/24/17, 12:36:33 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Your lab dinner less fancy than you thought? 😂
[8/24/17, 12:37:30 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: As long as I attend it, stays fancy 😛
[8/24/17, 12:37:48 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: But Gaucho! Supposed to be super awesome for non-vegetarians! Go! Go!
[8/24/17, 12:38:02 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Well considering they had to make a special meal for you. 😋
[8/24/17, 12:38:24 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Best carrots I ever had :P
[8/24/17, 12:38:25 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: It issss! I went on my birthday last year. It's 😍
[8/24/17, 12:38:35 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: I wanted to eat everything on the menu
[8/24/17, 12:39:27 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I can imagine. "Phoodie" you 😂
[8/24/17, 12:40:12 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Don't mock me 😞😒
[8/24/17, 12:42:19 PM] Maitreya Naik: Nicky's Thai Kitchen

https://goo.gl/maps/Hr5KNXF7H622
[8/24/17, 12:43:14 PM] Maitreya Naik: I was about to suggest Gaucho but depends on whether we have any vegetarians joining
[8/24/17, 12:48:01 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Gaucho closes at 9 so we'll have to go earlier. 7ish?
[8/24/17, 12:48:52 PM] Maitreya Naik: Works for me
[8/24/17, 12:52:38 PM] Maitreya Naik: Need to call anyone not on this group?
[8/24/17, 12:53:33 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: We should ask on Summer
[8/24/17, 1:03:50 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: 54 at 7.15 from Fifth and beauty Craig?
[8/24/17, 1:04:02 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: ~beauty~
[8/24/17, 1:11:12 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Is that good?
[8/24/17, 1:11:24 PM] Shivam Gupta: It's beauty😝
[8/24/17, 1:13:36 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Cool! Who else is coming?
[8/24/17, 1:13:42 PM] Shivam Gupta: Me
[8/24/17, 1:13:46 PM] Shivam Gupta: Hi! Me
[8/24/17, 1:13:55 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: The bus also comes on centre so if that works better for you guys
[8/24/17, 1:17:41 PM] Shivam Gupta: Are we going to Gaucho Parilla?
[8/24/17, 1:18:42 PM] Maitreya Naik: @14128166635 ?
[8/24/17, 1:19:49 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Anywhere. 54 if we are going there. 

Or we can go to the Thai place. Anything works.
[8/24/17, 1:20:00 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Yeah go ahead and ask?
[8/24/17, 1:20:19 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Craig _is_ beautiful
[8/24/17, 1:20:38 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: It has UG on it ❤
[8/24/17, 1:20:45 PM] Shivam Gupta: Gaucho is good👍🏽👌🏽
[8/24/17, 1:22:04 PM] Maitreya Naik: Yes!
[8/24/17, 1:24:19 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: @12144055438 I didn't mean let's go to UG tonight :P
[8/24/17, 1:24:39 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: I think the plan is Gaucho
[8/24/17, 1:24:44 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: No union grill. Pls. I've eaten everything on the menu :/
[8/24/17, 1:24:48 PM] Maitreya Naik: If veggies are interested
[8/24/17, 1:24:51 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: We can go to UG any old time
[8/24/17, 1:24:51 PM] Maitreya Naik: Oh haha
[8/24/17, 1:24:58 PM] Maitreya Naik: Okay
[8/24/17, 1:26:12 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Gaucho has veg food. Best carrots avk has tasted it seems.
[8/24/17, 1:27:29 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: i vouch for their carrots, anyday
[8/24/17, 1:27:35 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Yummm
[8/24/17, 1:27:48 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: <‎image omitted>
[8/24/17, 1:27:50 PM] Maitreya Naik: I remember I loved the appetizers. 
But we are going to Gaucho since you have had all of UG already
[8/24/17, 1:27:55 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: And if you are a vegetarian, they make you feel special
[8/24/17, 1:27:59 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: But do inform them
[8/24/17, 1:28:11 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: We had to inform that we had vegetarians!
[8/24/17, 1:28:34 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: They do seem to have a couple of good veg options.
[8/24/17, 1:28:47 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: But you will eat meat, no?
[8/24/17, 1:29:15 PM] Maitreya Naik: I remember the empanadas
[8/24/17, 1:29:15 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: http://eatgaucho.com
[8/24/17, 1:29:37 PM] Maitreya Naik: Ya
[8/24/17, 1:29:50 PM] Maitreya Naik: They were awesome
[8/24/17, 1:29:55 PM] Maitreya Naik: They got over so fast :(
[8/24/17, 1:29:55 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: The menu is there with prices! If everyone finds something good and reasonable, let's go there. :)
[8/24/17, 1:30:11 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: I read somewhere that it's in top 50 restaurants in the US.
[8/24/17, 1:31:05 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Let me know! I'm free to leave at 7 or anytime after :)
[8/24/17, 1:32:01 PM] Maitreya Naik: We are going to Gaucho 😂 But kudos to convincing strength
[8/24/17, 1:32:15 PM] Maitreya Naik: So, reach by 7:30pm?
[8/24/17, 1:32:19 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: 🤔?
[8/24/17, 1:33:29 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: The bus I'm thinking of taking will reach Gaucho at 7.36.
[8/24/17, 1:33:54 PM] Maitreya Naik: Take it!
[8/24/17, 1:34:11 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Okay. Will do.
[8/24/17, 1:34:16 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: See you
[8/24/17, 1:34:22 PM] Maitreya Naik: 😁
[8/24/17, 1:34:40 PM] Maitreya Naik: Everyone else, take that bus! 😋
[8/24/17, 1:44:41 PM] Shivam Gupta: 👌🏽
[8/24/17, 1:49:34 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Yeyyy much excite
[8/24/17, 2:09:54 PM] Shivam Gupta: So it seems the place generally requires reservation
[8/24/17, 2:10:12 PM] Shivam Gupta: I'm just calling now to see if we can get it
[8/24/17, 2:11:22 PM] Shivam Gupta: Shruti, Sanjay, Mai, Sid Raina and me. 

Anyone else i forgot to count?
[8/24/17, 2:11:53 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: @14129613758
[8/24/17, 2:11:59 PM] Shivam Gupta: Okay!
[8/24/17, 2:14:10 PM] Shivam Gupta: They said there'll be approx 20 mins wait time at 7:20, once you show up with all the people. No reservations
[8/24/17, 2:15:31 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Okay. So we all need to reach in order to get a table? Meh
[8/24/17, 2:16:07 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Oh but it's a queue system, you order at the register, so I guess it makes sense
[8/24/17, 2:17:18 PM] Shivam Gupta: Yeah!
[8/24/17, 2:57:53 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Are we BOOB?
[8/24/17, 2:58:02 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: I'm sorry, that didn't come out right
[8/24/17, 2:58:12 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Are we bringing our own booze?
[8/24/17, 2:58:16 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: 🙈
[8/24/17, 3:05:13 PM] Maitreya Naik: 😂
[8/24/17, 4:03:45 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: I'm waiting at Fifth and Oakland for the 54. It's coming in 5 mins.
[8/24/17, 4:10:14 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: On the bus. @14129612581 you at Craig?
[8/24/17, 4:10:34 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Yep
[8/24/17, 4:10:59 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: See you in a few mins!
[8/24/17, 4:11:25 PM] Maitreya Naik: Sid and I will be reaching in 5mins.
[8/24/17, 4:11:35 PM] Maitreya Naik: At Gaucho
[8/24/17, 4:11:47 PM] Maitreya Naik: See you guys there
[8/24/17, 4:12:19 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Shivam?
[8/24/17, 4:12:41 PM] Maitreya Naik: He missed it. He will be taking a 87
[8/24/17, 4:12:42 PM] Shivam Gupta: I'll reach by 7:30
[8/24/17, 4:12:47 PM] Shivam Gupta: Taking the next bus
[8/24/17, 4:12:55 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Cool see u soon!
[8/24/17, 4:14:06 PM] Shivam Gupta: ✌🏻
[8/24/17, 4:14:10 PM] Maitreya Naik: <‎image omitted>
[8/24/17, 4:16:43 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Okay not bad haha :)
[8/24/17, 4:28:14 PM] Maitreya Naik: Sid and I are in the queue inside. So be a little rude and walk in
[8/24/17, 4:30:12 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Are you sure we can?
[8/24/17, 4:34:07 PM] Maitreya Naik: Possibly. We are reaching the counter. So if we reach we will put an order of a Beef and an order of a Veggie empanada?
[8/24/17, 4:34:32 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: They give tables according to the number of people
[8/24/17, 4:34:50 PM] Maitreya Naik: We are 5 or 6?
[8/24/17, 4:34:51 PM] Shivam Gupta: There is no vegetarian among us today
[8/24/17, 4:35:04 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Can you let people in front of you until we come? We should be there in five mins
[8/24/17, 4:36:52 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Also we should all order our things right because we dont want to stand in line again?
[8/24/17, 4:36:54 PM] Maitreya Naik: Ya. That's what I am doing
[8/24/17, 4:37:08 PM] Maitreya Naik: But come in if you arrive
[8/24/17, 4:39:32 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Almos there
[8/25/17, 6:46:51 PM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: Guys tomorrow tequila cowboy?
[8/25/17, 6:47:07 PM] Maitreya Naik: Maybe. No promises
[8/25/17, 6:51:25 PM] Koushik Bhavani: Yes 😬
[8/25/17, 6:54:12 PM] Shivam Gupta: Done
[8/25/17, 7:19:26 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: No. You ditched yesterday. 😒
[8/25/17, 7:22:20 PM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: You aren't here :P
[8/25/17, 7:25:40 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Shruti come!
[8/25/17, 7:25:58 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: You didn't meet me yesterday :P
[8/25/17, 7:43:45 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: I'm in Austin guys :P
[8/25/17, 7:43:50 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: 😒
[8/25/17, 7:44:15 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Have fun!!! Send some pictures please! Will miss :(
[8/25/17, 8:19:52 PM] Maitreya Naik: Send some pictures please :(

[9/2/17, 9:57:45 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Is it weird that I find the typos more shocking than the actual post ?
[9/2/17, 10:00:13 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Hmm yeah. 😛
[9/2/17, 10:01:01 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: *shrugs*
[9/2/17, 10:12:42 PM] Shivam Gupta: 😝

[9/3/17, 1:53:27 PM] Koushik Bhavani: Everyone needs to be fit
[9/3/17, 1:53:42 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I'll start gymming again soon. I'm not gonna play team sports.
[9/3/17, 1:54:27 PM] Shrivani CMU: Why not team sports? :O
[9/3/17, 1:56:33 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Coz I suck at them and I let down my team every time and it brings back horrible memories from school that I'd rather leave in some random corner of my head?
[9/3/17, 1:56:53 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Let my team down *
[9/3/17, 1:58:29 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Shouldn't you be like trying to get over those horrible memories by making new kickass ones :o
[9/3/17, 1:58:35 PM] Shrivani CMU: Oh alright! It's all about having fun at the end of the day 😊
[9/3/17, 1:58:36 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Go play basketball with Koushik today
[9/3/17, 1:59:18 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: School got too competitive sometimes
[9/3/17, 1:59:45 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I mean you still need to want to win at the end of the day..
[9/3/17, 2:00:12 PM] Shivam Gupta: No
[9/3/17, 2:00:20 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: No?!
[9/3/17, 2:00:34 PM] Koushik Bhavani: Yes bro always yes
[9/3/17, 2:00:41 PM] Shivam Gupta: It's about enjoying the game
[9/3/17, 2:00:45 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Not win. Want to win! Otherwise why are you even playing
[9/3/17, 2:01:00 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: To get fit
[9/3/17, 2:01:04 PM] Shivam Gupta: And giving your best
[9/3/17, 2:01:09 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: To have fun with friends
[9/3/17, 2:01:11 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: To get better
[9/3/17, 2:01:13 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: This is the reason :p
[9/3/17, 2:01:27 PM] Shivam Gupta: Yes!
[9/3/17, 2:01:28 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: To have happy endorphins get released
[9/3/17, 2:01:39 PM] Koushik Bhavani: Yes
[9/3/17, 2:01:44 PM] Koushik Bhavani: I support all of these

[9/3/17, 2:02:17 PM] Prithvi Shankar: Where are you playing? Squirrel Hill?
[9/3/17, 2:02:21 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Lol I've already played with you last year Koushik
[9/3/17, 2:02:25 PM] Shrivani CMU: I agree.. as long as you're satisfied. It should help you destress... Not the other way round
[9/3/17, 2:02:46 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I felt shitty after the fact. No endorphin business
[9/3/17, 2:02:49 PM] Koushik Bhavani: Guys let's not talk about what it does
[9/3/17, 2:02:51 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: So yeah, I'm good
[9/3/17, 2:02:54 PM] Koushik Bhavani: Let's play and experience
[9/3/17, 2:03:04 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I'll stick to the gym. Thanks for asking me!
[9/3/17, 2:03:14 PM] Shrivani CMU: 😂
[9/3/17, 2:21:19 PM] Prithvi Shankar: Thank you, @14129613758
[9/3/17, 2:21:32 PM] Shivam Gupta: Coming? @14128198111
[9/3/17, 2:21:49 PM] Prithvi Shankar: Where are you playing? 😅
[9/3/17, 2:21:55 PM] Koushik Bhavani: thu
[9/3/17, 2:21:57 PM] Koushik Bhavani: i thought i replied
[9/3/17, 2:22:01 PM] Shivam Gupta: Squirrel Hill
[9/3/17, 2:22:02 PM] Koushik Bhavani: yes squirrel hill
[9/3/17, 2:22:25 PM] Shivam Gupta: tsk tsk😪
[9/3/17, 2:22:32 PM] Prithvi Shankar: I'll let you know at 6 😅
[9/3/17, 2:22:53 PM] Koushik Bhavani: cool
[9/3/17, 3:21:10 PM] Michael RI: Out of town 😬
[9/4/17, 7:40:30 AM] Sid Dalmia CMU: Was out.. today?
[9/4/17, 8:19:41 AM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: Guys don't forget there are no escorts running today!
[9/4/17, 8:29:40 AM] Koushik Bhavani: Thanks :)
[9/4/17, 8:51:56 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Oh yeah.. Thanks
[9/4/17, 1:16:35 PM] Prithvi Shankar: <‎image omitted>
[9/4/17, 1:17:25 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Wow ..
[9/4/17, 1:17:42 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Woah
[9/4/17, 1:18:13 PM] Shivam Gupta: That's harsh
[9/4/17, 1:19:01 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: And stupid
[9/4/17, 1:19:05 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: 20 people marked it as a good question and the instructor still savage
[9/4/17, 1:20:56 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: You'd think a 40000 dollar tuition covered this shit
[9/4/17, 1:27:09 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: What class is this from?
[9/4/17, 1:27:17 PM] Prithvi Shankar: 15213
[9/4/17, 1:28:12 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Is this the course that's available in the summer too?
[9/4/17, 1:28:47 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: How is this relevant 🙃
[9/4/17, 1:29:05 PM] Prithvi Shankar: Yup.
[9/4/17, 1:29:17 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Because if people take it in the summer they probably aren't in the US to buy the textbook
[9/4/17, 1:29:38 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: So is there a cheaper international version of the textbook available or how do they get it in the summer?
[9/4/17, 1:29:40 PM] Prithvi Shankar: Introduction to Computer Systems
[9/4/17, 1:29:55 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Amazon?
[9/4/17, 1:30:02 PM] Prithvi Shankar: There's an Indian version
[9/4/17, 1:30:12 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: And that.
[9/4/17, 1:30:14 PM] Prithvi Shankar: for 600-700 rupees if I'm not wrong
[9/4/17, 1:30:23 PM] Prithvi Shankar: AVK had one
[9/4/17, 1:30:25 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Yes. Much much cheaper. 

That's why I asked.
[9/4/17, 1:30:27 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Is this the course Gauti and Akanksha are TAing?
[9/4/17, 1:30:48 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: This is $10 @14129615683
[9/4/17, 1:30:49 PM] Prithvi Shankar: Nope. They're TAs for the ECE version of the course
[9/4/17, 1:30:52 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Yep I bought it there for this reason 😋
[9/4/17, 1:31:15 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: 10% .. wow
[9/4/17, 1:31:21 PM] Prithvi Shankar: Which uses the same book 😛
[9/4/17, 1:31:32 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Are the authors of the book related in any way with CMU?
[9/4/17, 1:31:43 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: I wonder why CMU can't make the international version available? Or is that illegal?
[9/4/17, 1:31:45 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: To*
[9/4/17, 1:32:00 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Sold only in third world countries
[9/4/17, 1:32:17 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Not even all of them.
[9/4/17, 1:32:20 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: I see :/
[9/4/17, 1:32:27 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: If at all
[9/4/17, 1:32:31 PM] Prithvi Shankar: Yes. Both are CMU instructors and the prof who replied is one of the
[9/4/17, 1:32:34 PM] Prithvi Shankar: them *
[9/4/17, 1:32:39 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Whaaaaaat
[9/4/17, 1:32:41 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Hahahhaha
[9/4/17, 1:32:53 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: So they just want people to buy their book for $$?
[9/4/17, 1:32:56 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: We're the books written while they were at CMU?
[9/4/17, 1:33:01 PM] Prithvi Shankar: Yes
[9/4/17, 1:33:02 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Wtf 🐣
[9/4/17, 1:33:07 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Mmh
[9/4/17, 1:33:11 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Crazy
[9/4/17, 1:33:42 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Anyway, nowadays there is no *one* book for a topic.
[9/4/17, 1:33:46 PM] Prithvi Shankar: AFAIK. they don't get a cut from every book. They'd have been paid by the publishing company. Better sales mean they might be asked to release an updated edition or might get to sell a new book
[9/4/17, 1:33:47 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Si. Ply get an alternative
[9/4/17, 1:33:51 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Simply *
[9/4/17, 1:33:56 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: 100$ for a book hmm. Too damn expensive
[9/4/17, 1:34:00 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Ahhhh yes you're right
[9/4/17, 1:34:09 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Yeah it's weird
[9/4/17, 1:34:19 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: That is true but somewhat irrelevant.
[9/4/17, 1:34:31 PM] Prithvi Shankar: International editions are meant to be sold only in specific countries
[9/4/17, 1:34:42 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: To support authors around the world...
[9/4/17, 1:34:48 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Your mom is irrelevant
[9/4/17, 1:34:53 PM] Prithvi Shankar: Like the Indian edition says on the cover that it can be sold only in India, Pakistan or Bangladesh
[9/4/17, 1:34:59 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: She is, so is the price.
[9/4/17, 1:35:30 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Glad we agree on something :P
[9/4/17, 1:35:58 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Oye. I remember there being electronic version though. Stuff that people scan and upload. I remember Scoobies frantically searching for some
[9/4/17, 1:36:03 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Last summer
[9/4/17, 1:36:14 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Yeah books are always a lot cheaper in the Indian subcontinent at least
[9/4/17, 1:36:33 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Even novels.
[9/4/17, 1:36:37 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: libgen, guys 🤗
[9/4/17, 1:36:47 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: And that book is decently expensive in India for Indian standards
[9/4/17, 1:36:49 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I found a book at blossoms for ₹400 which I bought in B&N for 20$
[9/4/17, 1:36:59 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I cried that day
[9/4/17, 1:37:03 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Okay, no I didn't.

[9/4/17, 1:37:19 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Yes you did! Haha cute :P
[9/4/17, 4:37:48 PM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: Normal buses are working today na?
[9/4/17, 4:40:02 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Yes
[9/4/17, 4:42:20 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Holiday schedule

[9/5/17, 8:19:56 AM] Prithvi Shankar: How are your new friends? 😛
[9/5/17, 8:20:07 AM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: But BA puts a limit on the cabin bag size
[9/5/17, 8:20:21 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Yeah dumbass isn't understanding that
[9/5/17, 8:20:21 AM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: You can't really put 23kgs in such a small bag

[9/14/17, 9:55:27 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Only down side to that is, in case you don't have H1B and you want to switch jobs in these 3 years, that 90 day unemployment period will be partially used up now
[9/14/17, 10:00:56 AM] Maitreya Naik: I think the 90 day unemployment is once the EAD starts
[9/14/17, 10:01:12 AM] Maitreya Naik: We are allowed 60 days of unemployment after our degre completion
[9/14/17, 10:01:25 AM] Maitreya Naik: Which is not taken out from EAD
[9/14/17, 10:02:07 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Yes. That's what
[9/14/17, 10:02:12 AM] Prithvi Shankar: So if you put Jan 15
[9/14/17, 10:02:23 AM] Prithvi Shankar: But end up starting Feb 10

[9/14/17, 12:06:42 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Guy, the 90 day unemployment is for the first 12 months only, or is it for the entire 36 month period (OPT + STEM extension)?
[9/14/17, 12:14:36 PM] Deepak Gopinath CMU: Assuming I'm this 'guy', that's only for first 12 months
[9/14/17, 12:14:51 PM] Deepak Gopinath CMU: You get an additional 60 after extension I think
[9/14/17, 12:15:45 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: You're always the 'guy' ❤
[9/14/17, 12:16:15 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Thanks! :) And does the balance from the 90 days carry over to the extension period?

[10/9/17, 1:19:22 PM] Prithvi Shankar: Koushik?
[10/9/17, 1:23:32 PM] Koushik Bhavani: No need Avk
[10/9/17, 1:26:37 PM] Koushik Bhavani: No, need Avk *
[10/9/17, 1:33:18 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Hahahaha how much the meaning changed 😂❤️
[10/9/17, 1:33:37 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: They still think I am a student there I think 😅
[10/9/17, 3:04:30 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: haha I was waiting for the fight
[10/12/17, 7:50:57 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Koushik and AVK never fight booo :P
[10/12/17, 7:51:03 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: https://instagram.com/p/BaInXGBg9G7/
[10/12/17, 7:51:17 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: ^This is so satisfying to look at..
[10/12/17, 7:51:56 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: They are using auction to hood the panel right..?
[10/12/17, 7:52:10 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Suction*, hold*
[10/12/17, 7:52:15 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Wow yes it is
[10/12/17, 7:52:21 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Satisfying
[10/12/17, 7:53:14 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Yeah
[10/12/17, 7:54:16 AM] Shrivani CMU: That's probably true.
[10/12/17, 7:54:24 AM] Shrivani CMU: Looks good 😄
[10/12/17, 7:57:11 AM] Maitreya Naik: Did anyone else go "Aaaaaa" when the arm on the right escapes the press (because efficiency and brilliant planning) ?
[10/12/17, 8:36:27 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: ^yeah! :D
[10/12/17, 8:41:03 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: I always used to think before that seeing a robot work would be super impressive to people in other streams of life, but to a roboticist it'll just be "meh" because they build this stuff. Turns out it's actually the other way around 😂
[10/12/17, 8:42:30 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: ^ unless it's androids. Lots of people are impressed by androids.
[10/12/17, 8:45:12 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: That's true. But I think the part that they're impressed with is different. Everyone would probably be like "Woahh, that looks and walks like a human!" and robotics peeps would be like "Woahh, that robot didn't fall flat on its face like it did in the 2000 demos we did in the lab last night"
[10/12/17, 8:45:56 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Isn't that true with all other things as well?
[10/12/17, 8:46:27 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Yeah, I'm sure it is!
[10/12/17, 8:47:09 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Though sometimes it's the 'yeah right' reaction :p
[10/12/17, 8:47:18 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: Haha this is so true 😂
[10/12/17, 8:48:11 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Too much truth in this one haha!
[10/12/17, 8:49:50 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: Says the guys who works on software? 😜
[10/12/17, 8:51:30 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: That's a long reply AVK 😅
[10/12/17, 8:52:03 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: What's software but a bunch of temporary hack arounds and hard coded shit that makes the robot work maybe twice in ten times? :P
As long as it works, impressed! :D
[10/12/17, 8:52:29 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: 👌
[10/12/17, 8:52:42 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: But hey hey. That's not what we do um. Yep. 😛
[10/12/17, 8:53:30 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: 😂
[10/12/17, 8:53:55 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: Guy*
[10/12/17, 8:54:01 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Ouch
[10/12/17, 8:54:19 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: (cough) Robot autonomy (cough)
[10/12/17, 8:55:11 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: 😅😂

[10/12/17, 7:09:09 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Does Kohli's sell plastic forks?
[10/13/17, 12:45:58 AM] Maitreya Naik: Horror?
"Poughkeepsie Tapes"
[10/14/17, 11:36:51 AM] Koushik Bhavani: Basketball today ?

[10/14/17, 11:40:00 AM] Koushik Bhavani: 😑😑

[10/14/17, 8:22:51 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: <‎image omitted>
[10/14/17, 8:23:11 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Life is so good I have time to actually have one haha
[10/14/17, 8:23:35 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: River Flows In You. Anybody know the song? It's so goooood
[10/14/17, 8:25:39 PM] Prithvi Shankar: you learnt? 😁
[10/14/17, 8:26:26 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Learning
[10/14/17, 8:26:34 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Learnt the three lines I scribbled haha
[10/14/17, 8:32:15 PM] Maitreya Naik: You guys have to watch Bladerunner 2049 in a theatre
[10/14/17, 8:33:05 PM] Maitreya Naik: Learn dude. It's a very pleasant song
[10/14/17, 8:36:27 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Do you have time to play or do you just "have" it?
[10/14/17, 8:39:04 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I started today. I am thinking one song a week? This song is super small. Three minutes. My start and goal songs are :
[10/14/17, 8:39:07 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: <‎image omitted>
[10/14/17, 8:39:26 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Hopefully this won't turn out to be like the guitar plan haha.
[10/14/17, 8:39:54 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I am sure Shruti can play these effortlessly
[10/14/17, 8:40:07 PM] Koushik Bhavani: Nice
[10/14/17, 8:40:44 PM] Koushik Bhavani: I am sure you’ll play it as well as you play the guitar
[10/14/17, 8:41:10 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Booo. This is easier than guitar since I learned anyway :P
[10/14/17, 8:43:33 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: hahahaha
[10/14/17, 8:43:33 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: 💪
[10/14/17, 9:02:47 PM] Michael RI: Have you heard the psychological thing about telling people your goals before you do them? :P
[10/14/17, 9:03:01 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: You never do them then?
[10/14/17, 9:03:18 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: It's you just trying to show off that you are doing something but you actually won't?
[10/14/17, 9:04:54 PM] Michael RI: Kind of... i think it's like you get a little satisfaction from sharing your plans which makes you feel like you already accomplished something. And since you already feel like you've accomplished something you are a bit less likely to finish the goal
[10/14/17, 9:05:11 PM] Michael RI: I've tested it out myself actually
[10/14/17, 9:05:22 PM] Koushik Bhavani: No wonder me and Avk didn’t learn guitar
[10/14/17, 9:05:26 PM] Michael RI: And either way I just end up not doing it 🙂
[10/14/17, 9:05:56 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Yeah we seem to have tested that hypothesis too
[10/14/17, 9:05:58 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Dammit
[10/14/17, 9:06:01 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Mike
[10/14/17, 9:06:08 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Now if I don't finish it's all because of you
[10/14/17, 9:06:09 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Grr
[10/14/17, 9:06:15 PM] Michael RI: Hahaha
[10/14/17, 9:06:20 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Now I feel like I should feel accomplished :P
[10/14/17, 9:06:26 PM] Koushik Bhavani: Not once you have tested it like a thousand times
[10/14/17, 9:38:32 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Yeah, nice choice!
[10/14/17, 9:40:01 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: There is a counter hypothesis which says that if you tell people about the goals, you're more likely to do them because you don't want to be shown up
[10/14/17, 9:45:04 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Only if you give fucks. What if you don't give fucks.
[10/14/17, 9:45:18 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Very true
[10/14/17, 9:45:25 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: What about you AVK?
[10/14/17, 9:47:01 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Saving a few for the future, I'd give most :D
[10/14/17, 10:39:16 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Even if you do give fucks, sometimes it gets hard to accomplish the goal :/
[10/14/17, 10:39:48 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Yusss
[10/14/17, 10:40:39 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Avk also try La Valse D'Amélie from Amélie
[10/14/17, 10:41:02 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I've been trying to learn it on and off for a while now
[10/14/17, 10:49:15 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Amelie 💛
[10/14/17, 10:49:46 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I still have to watch it btw
[10/14/17, 10:51:03 PM] Maitreya Naik: You haven't watched it yet! :I

[10/15/17, 10:09:20 AM] Akanksha Periwal CMU: Hey !
If someone does a degree in data science, would working in a normal SDE field be considered okay for OPT ?
[10/15/17, 10:09:34 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: Yes.
[10/15/17, 10:09:46 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: SDE = Software Development?
[10/15/17, 10:10:09 AM] Akanksha Periwal CMU: Yup !
[10/15/17, 10:14:47 AM] Maitreya Naik: It should be
[10/15/17, 10:24:21 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: Anyone traveling to Bangalore in December, and has either already booked tickets or looking to book tickets now? :P
[10/15/17, 10:26:06 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Me maybe
[10/15/17, 10:26:09 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I am and I have
[10/15/17, 10:26:42 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: Awesome :D
[10/15/17, 10:26:44 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Is it actually risky to leave the US without a job or are those just rumours I'm hearing?
[10/15/17, 10:27:12 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: You can definitely leave if you have an EAD card and OPT approval.
[10/15/17, 10:27:41 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: Even if you don't, you just need it to arrive before you come back. So that sometime you know here can send it to you.
[10/15/17, 10:27:41 AM] Aum Jadhav: It is risky to come back. You need the EAD and a job offer to re-enter the US
[10/15/17, 10:27:57 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: You don't need a job offer
[10/15/17, 10:28:14 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: You just need OPT approval (EAD card)
[10/15/17, 10:28:43 AM] Aum Jadhav: People I know have been asked for job details when coming back for OPT. Not legally required, but strongly recommended
[10/15/17, 10:29:08 AM] Aum Jadhav: Will have you unnecessary trouble at the airport
[10/15/17, 10:29:12 AM] Aum Jadhav: Save*
[10/15/17, 10:29:34 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: Oh really? This I don't know
[10/15/17, 10:29:59 AM] Maitreya Naik: Ya. It is recommended to carry the offer letter by OIE too
[10/15/17, 10:30:00 AM] Aum Jadhav: God bless CBP :P
[10/15/17, 10:30:42 AM] Aum Jadhav: Ditto for Mumbai. Anyone?
[10/15/17, 4:11:30 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Any RI person on campus?
[10/15/17, 4:11:39 PM] Aum Jadhav: Ssup
[10/15/17, 4:12:01 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Where are you?
[10/15/17, 4:15:38 PM] Aum Jadhav: 4228

[10/19/17, 8:56:10 PM] Maitreya Naik: Happy New Year everyone!
[10/19/17, 10:39:24 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I need an analogy
[10/19/17, 10:40:23 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: The setting is something like this:
you can see a certain distance away. Something might look good, but you won't know if it good unless you a_actually_ go to it
[10/19/17, 10:41:44 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Say I have a light that shines a certain distance away. But this light does not show me the truth but only hallucinatory. It might show me paths or ways that are actually not traversable. But I wont know until I actually take that path and crash into something that the path is not traversable
[10/19/17, 10:42:20 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: It can also be something where I can see a little into the future but my vision of the future is cloudy so I cant trust it fully/
[10/19/17, 10:42:30 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Some story or some analogy along those lines
[10/19/17, 10:49:12 PM] Maitreya Naik: The bright light at the end of the dark tunnel may be a doorway out. Or maybe it's just a tiny crack, teasing you with a light, that can be reached only past the wall
[10/19/17, 11:05:09 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Interesting, I'll try using it :)
[10/19/17, 11:05:13 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: On a different note:
[10/19/17, 11:05:14 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Physarum polycephalum has been shown to exhibit intelligent characteristics. For example, a team of Japanese and Hungarian researchers have shown P. polycephalum can solve the Shortest path problem. When grown in a maze with oatmeal at two spots, P. polycephalum retracts from everywhere in the maze, except the shortest route connecting the two food sources.[2] When presented with more than two food sources, P. polycephalum apparently solves a more complicated transportation problem. With more than two sources, the amoeba also produces efficient networks.[3] In a 2010 paper, oatflakes were dispersed to represent Tokyo and 36 surrounding towns.[4][5] P. polycephalum created a network similar to the existing train system, and "with comparable efficiency, fault tolerance, and cost". Some researchers claim that P. polycephalum is even able to solve the NP-hard Steiner minimum tree problem.[8]

[11/8/17, 9:39:41 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: <‎image omitted>

[11/9/17, 8:23:22 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I know some good board game enthusiasts
[11/9/17, 8:23:31 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I am just being lazy in going and playing with them
[11/10/17, 7:01:26 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: https://www.facebook.com/9gaglab/videos/468364026893238/
[11/10/17, 7:01:32 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: It’s been a while
[11/10/17, 7:01:52 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: And they’ve put a lot of effort into this one. It’s really good!
[11/10/17, 7:08:10 AM] Maitreya Naik: Ya. XD
 Saw it a week ago I think
[11/10/17, 7:13:04 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: Saw this a while back. Amaze only
[11/10/17, 7:17:59 AM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: Nice!😅
[11/10/17, 7:22:03 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Btw guys, there’s apparently a Justice League premier on Tuesday (the movie comes out in theatres on Friday) in McConomy at 9pm
[11/10/17, 8:51:58 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Boo. Horrible sound. Don't do that to yourself.
[11/10/17, 9:00:35 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: But it's free :P
[11/10/17, 9:01:06 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Not worth it.
[11/10/17, 9:01:13 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It destroyed La La Land.
[11/10/17, 9:01:18 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: You were there.
[11/10/17, 9:01:56 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Also, get moviepass. Lol
[11/10/17, 9:04:29 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: True. But on the bright side, there isn't going to be any singing in Justice League (at least I hope there isn't).
[11/10/17, 9:04:43 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Hans Zimmer music.
[11/10/17, 9:04:52 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: So it'll just be Batman's growly voice getting more growly on their sound system
[11/10/17, 9:05:07 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Well, yeah
[11/10/17, 9:05:19 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: There is no argument here, Sanjay :p
[11/10/17, 9:05:26 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: At least not in my head.
[11/10/17, 9:05:33 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Fine :P
[11/10/17, 9:05:35 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: If you still wanna go, I can't stop you haha
[11/10/17, 9:06:13 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Let's watch it here, and if it's not pathetic, we can always watch it again at the theatre :D
[11/10/17, 9:06:26 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: *facepalm*
[11/10/17, 9:06:45 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: You go do that. I'll watch it in the theatre for free.
[11/10/17, 9:07:42 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Okay, but I'll go with you :P
[11/10/17, 9:07:42 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: So let me know when you're going
[11/10/17, 9:08:12 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Haha okay
[11/10/17, 9:46:05 AM] Maitreya Naik: Wait. How?
[11/10/17, 9:46:27 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Moviepass
[11/10/17, 9:47:20 AM] Maitreya Naik: How much is that for?
[11/10/17, 9:51:09 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: 9.95 a month
[11/10/17, 9:51:17 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Second movie + is free lol
[11/10/17, 9:51:28 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: ^ effectively
[11/10/17, 9:51:42 AM] Maitreya Naik: So can I just buy it for one month?
[11/10/17, 9:51:47 AM] Maitreya Naik: Instead of a subscription?
[11/10/17, 9:51:51 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I wouldn't do that if I were you
[11/10/17, 9:52:04 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Coz if you wanna subscribe again, you'll have to wait 9 months or something
[11/10/17, 9:52:14 AM] Maitreya Naik: Lol. Bs
[11/10/17, 9:52:29 AM] Maitreya Naik: Can you buy multiple tickets on the same day to the same show? :P
[11/10/17, 9:52:32 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: No
[11/10/17, 9:52:37 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: One ticket per day
[11/10/17, 9:52:55 AM] Maitreya Naik: Lol
[11/10/17, 9:53:09 AM] Maitreya Naik: Okay. So when are we watching justice league?
[11/10/17, 9:53:21 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Useful only if you watch a lot of movies no?
[11/10/17, 9:53:29 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: 9.95 per month. Too expensive
[11/10/17, 9:53:29 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Very useful
[11/10/17, 9:53:29 AM] Maitreya Naik: Exactly
[11/10/17, 9:53:58 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: You probably watch a movie a month or less and with student discount you can get away with a cheaper deal
[11/10/17, 9:54:26 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Cheaper deal if you just buy the ticket like usual I mean
[11/10/17, 9:55:19 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: You != Me lol
[11/10/17, 9:55:23 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I love this deal
[11/10/17, 9:56:05 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: 👍
[11/10/17, 10:03:50 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: On Tuesday first
[11/10/17, 10:03:59 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: And then again whenever :P
[11/10/17, 10:14:19 AM] Maitreya Naik: I'm in
[11/10/17, 10:14:29 AM] Maitreya Naik: For this too
[11/10/17, 10:35:58 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: <‎image omitted>
[11/10/17, 10:38:57 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Huh?
[11/10/17, 10:39:41 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Context: They were going to consider our stipend _and_ tuition waiver as income and as taxable
[11/10/17, 10:40:34 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Which would have meant graduate students like me would end up _paying_ out of pocket during grad days. Now that's off. :)
[11/10/17, 10:43:58 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Ohhh yayyy
[11/10/17, 10:44:13 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: That was a quick turnaround in position
[11/10/17, 10:50:35 AM] Deepak Gopinath CMU: Not everyone gets student discount...
[11/10/17, 11:53:25 AM] Maitreya Naik: Anyone going to the exhibition

[11/10/17, 4:19:17 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: There is a fair bit

[12/1/17, 1:50:25 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Who is 'Kratika Jain'?
[12/1/17, 1:50:56 PM] Prithvi Shankar: Ask Sidzoo 😛
[12/1/17, 1:51:04 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Sidzoo knows her?
[12/1/17, 1:51:21 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Lol she's sent some business proposal to me on FB
[12/1/17, 1:51:59 PM] Prithvi Shankar: He has all the answers you seek.
[12/1/17, 1:52:07 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: This sounds promising
[12/1/17, 1:52:12 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I'll ask him :p

[12/1/17, 9:18:35 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: <‎image omitted>
[12/1/17, 9:18:45 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I'm starting to play this rn, anyone else wanna join in?
[12/1/17, 9:19:02 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: (The trigger warnings are apparently legit, just saying)
[12/1/17, 9:19:10 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: (and it's free on steam)
[12/1/17, 10:00:13 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: This doesn't look like psychological horror.
[12/1/17, 10:00:30 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: This is true.
[12/1/17, 10:00:51 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: But I've heard it gets there.
[12/1/17, 10:01:09 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I'm going to keep you posted if you want.
[12/1/17, 10:01:57 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: There have been some "wait what?" moments already, though.
[12/1/17, 10:54:09 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Lol. My fan is making sounds like it's from hell.
[12/1/17, 10:54:17 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: <‎audio omitted>
[12/1/17, 10:59:59 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Also, it's getting there. It's getting serious.
[12/1/17, 11:03:14 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It seemed to be mostly poetry at the beginning, but it gets heavy.
[12/1/17, 11:14:47 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Creepy
[12/1/17, 11:15:06 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Imagine what I was feeling like
[12/1/17, 11:33:24 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Really really super legit. Don't do it if you don't want to.
[12/1/17, 11:33:40 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I need daylight to play more of this and I don't think I even should.
[12/1/17, 11:37:29 PM] Maitreya Naik: @14129547000 @14129614621 same. Found out anything more?
[12/1/17, 11:40:32 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: No. Not responding to her.
[12/4/17, 9:21:38 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: She keeps asking for my phone number because apparently she can't give details over chat
[12/4/17, 9:39:52 AM] Maitreya Naik: Tch
[12/4/17, 9:40:05 AM] Maitreya Naik: Weird
[12/4/17, 10:02:32 AM] ‪+1 (412) 218‑8424‬: She contacted me too. Later when I spoke to her over the phone she said Can we meet and discuss the idea. Found everything really weird. She said she is working on some social network and ecommerce entrepreneurial project with a lot of *professionals* in Pittsburgh. I never met her to actually discuss the idea but the whole thing was just weird
[12/4/17, 10:03:10 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Hahahahahaahaa
[12/4/17, 10:03:15 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I know what this shit is!!!
[12/4/17, 10:03:28 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: It's about fuckshit Amway!! Haha!
[12/4/17, 10:04:12 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I mean I have nothing against Amway
[12/4/17, 10:04:31 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: They are great. Just some people who advertise it in weird ways. :)
[12/4/17, 10:04:33 AM] ‪+1 (412) 218‑8424‬: The pyramid scheme scam. Might actually be that because if she says Amway in a message or over the phone people might outright say No
[12/4/17, 10:05:47 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Yeah it is the pyramid scheme. I actually talked to couple of them. They wasted an hour or more until they actually got to the point after incessant pleading by me to do so. And then realised they were talking about illegal nonsense.
[12/4/17, 10:08:27 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: hahah this is the second time in recent times for me to be contacted by these scheme!
[12/4/17, 10:08:30 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: *schemes
[12/4/17, 10:09:04 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I did ask if it was like that and she said no
[12/4/17, 10:09:15 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: But yeah, i'm sure it'll come down to it
[12/4/17, 10:10:44 AM] ‪+1 (412) 218‑8424‬: The other thing really weird was she said she needed people to work on the business aspect of the project. So I asked why not the tech aspect ? Is that done? So she said we are looking to work on the business aspect first and later work on tech, which is *really* weird for a social network and ecommerce project.
[12/4/17, 10:11:58 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Did she ever say what the business actually is?
[12/4/17, 10:11:58 AM] Maitreya Naik: She might as well not use words like project and start using words like "thing" if she is going to be so general about everything
[12/4/17, 10:12:08 AM] ‪+1 (412) 218‑8424‬: Nope never
[12/4/17, 10:12:29 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Did she try and say that this would help you make a lot of money on the side?
[12/4/17, 10:13:53 AM] ‪+1 (412) 218‑8424‬: Nope and I never asked her about it too
[12/4/17, 10:21:15 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Btw, asking for a friend. What does a Chem Masters student's CV look like? As in, how many publications and/or conference presentations would be normal? 3-4? More?
[12/4/17, 10:50:12 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I was contacted last year also by someone right in Giant Eagle. He kept badgering me for my phone number and then when he later called me I kinda shut him out.
[12/4/17, 10:50:40 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Annoying af.
[12/4/17, 10:52:05 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: Haha me too! 😂

[12/4/17, 10:57:03 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Me saying chill fired you up more? Oops :P
[12/4/17, 11:17:03 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: I remember this! You were so chatty with him 😂
[12/4/17, 11:23:51 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: Yeah he came up to me and he's like "You seem like a smart guy". And I was like finally someone recognizes my awesomeness 😛

[12/4/17, 11:39:06 AM] Maitreya Naik: 😂

[12/14/17, 6:34:30 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: You can see Shivam's pretty face
[12/14/17, 6:46:21 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Two prisoners in two different rooms. The jailer goes to each one of them, tosses a coin, shows it to the prisoner and then asks, what do you think the other prisoner got given this information? If at least one of them is right, they get to live another day. If both of them are wrong, they are made to watch Dhinchak Pooja videos forever. Can you save them from such torture by suggesting a strategy?
[12/14/17, 7:25:37 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Prisoners dilemma
[12/14/17, 7:25:51 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Hmm. With chance mixed in
[12/14/17, 8:50:28 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: It doesn't seem like there's a pure strategy that's a best response. Is there?
[12/14/17, 8:50:56 PM] Shivam Gupta: They both got nothing :P
[12/14/17, 8:51:01 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: There is a deterministic solution for them to continue living forever
[12/14/17, 8:54:18 PM] Aum Jadhav: #GradAItopper
[12/14/17, 8:54:33 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Lol I wish 😂
[12/14/17, 8:55:47 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: By this information do you mean the same side of the coin toss or do you mean whether the other prisoner got to see the coin at all?
[12/14/17, 8:56:16 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: The prisoner gets to see what he got
[12/14/17, 8:56:24 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: but he needs to guess what the other guy got
[12/14/17, 8:56:33 PM] Shivam Gupta: And it's a fair coin?
[12/14/17, 8:56:36 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: totes
[12/14/17, 8:59:19 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Ooh ooh ooh
[12/14/17, 8:59:22 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: I know I know
[12/14/17, 8:59:33 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: But I won't ruin it for everyone :)
[12/14/17, 9:00:39 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: He got it :D
[12/14/17, 9:01:31 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: I was trying to find a Nash equilibrium and all 😂😂
[12/14/17, 9:03:51 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Ooo I got it too :D
[12/14/17, 9:04:37 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Haha nice this was the giveaway. I thought only a probabilistic solution can exist
[12/14/17, 9:08:58 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Though. The solution I am thinking of requires coordination between them, which defeats the whole prisoner set up. So I don't know if i got it
[12/14/17, 9:09:30 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Oh I don't think the prisoners get to talk to each other if that's what you mean
[12/14/17, 9:10:27 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: So does your solution work even if they don't know what the other said?
[12/14/17, 9:10:34 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Yeah
[12/14/17, 9:11:07 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Gautam, if Akanskha asks you the solution don't tell her 😛
[12/14/17, 9:11:15 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: 😂

[12/14/17, 9:14:40 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Oops 😅
[12/14/17, 9:14:57 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I typed so fast keyboard got confused
[12/14/17, 9:33:43 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Aditi!
[12/14/17, 9:33:59 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: They can discuss the strategy!
[12/14/17, 9:34:20 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: OH. thanks -.-

[12/14/17, 9:35:42 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: If they can discuss
[12/14/17, 9:35:50 PM] Koushik Bhavani: I already scolded him
[12/14/17, 9:35:52 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Please send another and say something. It was super disappointing to listen to silence. -.-
[12/14/17, 9:36:03 PM] Koushik Bhavani: 😂
[12/14/17, 9:36:16 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Haha you guys have clearly not heard ASMR?
[12/14/17, 9:36:23 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: And about its fans
[12/14/17, 9:36:26 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: They can discuss once before they are imprisoned!
[12/14/17, 9:36:32 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: If they can discuss strategy then I got it
[12/14/17, 9:36:38 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Reveal it here

[12/20/17, 7:17:17 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I guess :D
[12/20/17, 7:17:33 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: <‎image omitted>
[12/20/17, 7:18:23 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: What really pisses me off is in 7 segment displays, the number 1 is either all the way to the left or all the way to the right. (usually the latter iirc)
[12/20/17, 7:27:36 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: So many travelling today! Safe Travels peoples! Everybody's going different ways after this! Aaah! But hey, every May 15th is Funday Sunday summer retreat that I would be hosting ok. Yay.

[12/20/17, 8:01:27 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: "traipse", can't even say it's a GRE word. Maybe Shruti's level vocab. 😐
[12/20/17, 8:06:33 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Probably not the best usage here though
[12/20/17, 8:07:01 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It was fine usage lol
[12/20/17, 8:07:02 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: It apparently means something closer to “trudge”
[12/20/17, 8:07:03 AM] Koushik Bhavani: I swear
[12/20/17, 8:07:21 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: We should also play contact

[12/22/17, 7:54:55 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It's an amazing book, btw. It's similar to GoT and yet MUCH better. And it's kinda based on real events. It's called Shogun. James Clavell.

[12/22/17, 8:40:48 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: I myself haven't spoken to him properly since first sem. Poojita's his best friend :P
[12/22/17, 8:41:45 PM] Prithvi Shankar: Didn't you use his bathroom in the middle of the night? 😂

[12/23/17, 6:41:43 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: So I was doing some thinking - in the argand plane, do both the axes have the same scale?
Does it even matter?
[12/23/17, 6:42:33 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Nope, they are independent
[12/23/17, 6:42:35 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: (I'm reading a book that's making me understand complex numbers better)
[12/23/17, 6:42:41 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Thought so
[12/23/17, 6:43:00 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Hmm. Interesting.
[12/23/17, 10:11:08 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: What's? Found something cool? If you are interested in complex numbers, you should check out how they bring about rotations and how they don't scale in higher dimensions. Most books don't explain why. :)
[12/23/17, 10:11:38 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Ooh sounds cool.
[12/23/17, 10:12:15 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: My understanding of complex numbers from 11th and 12th is bad because of bad teaching :p it failed to generate interest in me despite being so interesting in itself.
[12/23/17, 10:12:32 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Now I'm curious. And I'm reading the book Fermat's last theorem
[12/23/17, 6:01:44 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Just played with a 7 week old Golden Retriever. Highly recommend it as a stress buster. :o

[12/29/17, 12:26:40 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Can there exist a place in space which is absolutely devoid of light from any stars? I.E. a place which is so far away from everything that no light has ever reached it?
[12/29/17, 12:26:55 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: (I'm reading the hitchhiker series :p)
[12/29/17, 12:28:14 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Struck *
[12/29/17, 12:47:57 AM] Prithvi Shankar: After a certain depth light doesn't reach the ocean. It's called the midnight zone.
[12/29/17, 12:48:28 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Also, I don't know how black hole works exactly.
[12/29/17, 12:48:52 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I meant in outer space, surrounded by vacuum

[12/29/17, 12:50:23 AM] Maitreya Naik: The most would be a place at the edge of the universe
[12/29/17, 12:50:24 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Coz there's no light
[12/29/17, 12:50:46 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I wonder what it'd be like there
[12/29/17, 12:50:51 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: If you had a spacesuit
[12/29/17, 12:50:59 AM] Maitreya Naik: That's definitely the midnight zone that prithvi mentioned
[12/29/17, 12:51:13 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Just listening to yourself breathe and maybe your heart beating, without anything else around you
[12/29/17, 12:51:17 AM] Maitreya Naik: It would require a body big enough, casting a shadow
[12/29/17, 12:51:27 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Fish down there sometimes emit light
[12/29/17, 12:51:27 AM] Maitreya Naik: Not possible in a vacuum
[12/29/17, 12:51:40 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Spacesuit dude
[12/29/17, 12:52:06 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I wouldn't be able to be there without one, coz the low temperature would kill me.
[12/29/17, 12:52:11 AM] Maitreya Naik: Ya. They evolved to do so. The angler fish uses its light to attract prey
[12/29/17, 12:52:12 AM] Maitreya Naik: Ya. Was about to say
[12/29/17, 12:52:35 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Ooh the temperature would be 0 K no?
[12/29/17, 12:52:40 AM] Maitreya Naik: You can do the same by snorkeling in the ocean really late
[12/29/17, 12:52:45 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Coz no light, no energy?
[12/29/17, 12:53:03 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: No man why don't you understand ? :P no matter around me except my suit
[12/29/17, 12:53:13 AM] Maitreya Naik: Interesting point. Ideally it should be
[12/29/17, 12:53:25 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Oceans / anywhere else dark enough does not satisfy this
[12/29/17, 12:53:42 AM] Maitreya Naik: Are you trying to understand the feeling or the location ? :p
[12/29/17, 12:55:06 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I'm just trying to test my imagination
[12/29/17, 12:55:18 AM] Maitreya Naik: You can go in a large dark room in the ISS after you stop its rotation that simulates gravity :P
[12/29/17, 12:55:26 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Tech
[12/29/17, 12:55:30 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Tch *
[12/29/17, 12:55:36 AM] Maitreya Naik: Well then, have you ever free falled?
[12/29/17, 12:55:45 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: No
[12/29/17, 12:57:08 AM] Maitreya Naik: Awesome. Try bungeeing off a bridge. From the mix of emotions of the fear of falling or hitting the ground, try to extract the feeling of freefall
[12/29/17, 12:57:15 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Sensory deprivation? Ish?
[12/29/17, 12:57:56 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: <‎image omitted>
[12/29/17, 12:58:38 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Any VR / other kinda stuff that is used to _simulate_ this kinda thing - not interested.
[12/29/17, 12:59:43 AM] Maitreya Naik: Is it this?
[12/29/17, 12:59:50 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I'm wondering two things:
1. If such a place actually exists out there in space (if it's actually possible to be so far away from everything based on current theories of how the universe is expanding, dark matter and all the other relevant stuff) 
2. What it'll feel like to actually be there.
[12/29/17, 1:00:53 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Coz if there is such a place, that means the expansion of the universe has gone beyond a scale which gravity can control no? The Big Tear has occurred, right? Or does it not mean that?
[12/29/17, 1:01:17 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Also getting there would be impossible for us. Maybe for something is already there (apart from light) but if we were to travel there, light would get there first/at the same time
[12/29/17, 1:01:23 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: You guys know about the Big Tear / Big Crunch theories right? (The Big Tear might not be called that)
[12/29/17, 1:01:44 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: It might just mean that the universe is expanding faster than the speed of light at some place
[12/29/17, 1:01:54 AM] Maitreya Naik: Well, 2 is more subjecive to your imagination and close to sensory deprivation apart from the cold
[12/29/17, 1:02:22 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Also I know current limitations of tech would not allow us to reach said place, but this is where sci fi comes in. Think Teleportation / Improbability Drove :p
[12/29/17, 1:02:36 AM] Maitreya Naik: You seem to suggest that the reach of gravity is as much as that of a light source. Is that a correct assumption though?
[12/29/17, 1:03:26 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Teleportation, how i wish we could!
[12/29/17, 1:03:39 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Well, gravity has an inverse square falloff. I'm pretty certain that the Betelgeuse star has inconsequential amounts of gravitational force exerted on us. I may be horribly wrong but this is what I assume.
[12/29/17, 1:03:53 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: My point is, those stars can still be seen in the night sky
[12/29/17, 1:04:03 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Drive *
[12/29/17, 1:05:32 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Also if things are so far away that light hasn't reached that place yet, that means that any two things that are diametrically opposite each other, considering this place as the centre, are twice as far apart.
[12/29/17, 1:05:42 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: You seeing where I'm going with this
[12/29/17, 1:05:43 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: ?
[12/29/17, 1:06:33 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Not exactly
[12/29/17, 1:07:49 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Honestly I don't see where I'm going with this either. Must be all the lack of light.
[12/29/17, 1:08:09 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: 😂
[12/29/17, 1:10:12 AM] Maitreya Naik: Nope
[12/29/17, 1:10:19 AM] Maitreya Naik: 😂😂
[12/29/17, 1:11:15 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I think this is what I was talking about. Can there be such a place? Can the force of gravity act at such a massive distance?
[12/29/17, 1:14:29 AM] Maitreya Naik: Btw, the temperature of the universe is 3K. Because of the remnant energy from the big bang
[12/29/17, 1:14:42 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Ah right, I forgot about that
[12/29/17, 1:14:52 AM] Maitreya Naik: The lack of light can still be rationalized by the absence of even dispersed light
[12/29/17, 1:15:07 AM] Maitreya Naik: As long as there's no light source directly reaching the point
[12/29/17, 1:16:21 AM] Maitreya Naik: Which suggests that your theoretical point of interest may exist not way far off
[12/29/17, 1:16:34 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I doubt it
[12/29/17, 1:16:35 AM] Maitreya Naik: But if you are interested particularly in a point that is way far off
[12/29/17, 1:16:49 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: You still see stars in the night sky
[12/29/17, 1:18:35 AM] Maitreya Naik: Thays not the ideal spot then
[12/29/17, 1:18:47 AM] Maitreya Naik: Think overlapping umbras
[12/29/17, 1:19:22 AM] Maitreya Naik: Umbras during multiple eclipses large enough to not allow any light in
[12/29/17, 1:19:45 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: This
[12/29/17, 1:19:47 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Read this
[12/29/17, 1:19:49 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/space/11550868/Giant-mysterious-empty-hole-found-in-universe.html
[12/29/17, 1:20:52 AM] Maitreya Naik: Hence, a spot with overlapping umbras and in the region around it where the eclipsing bodies don't overlap, there shouldn't exist a light source in the projected regions
[12/29/17, 1:21:47 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Lol I think I'm not able to put forth the idea I have in my mind out clearly.
[12/29/17, 1:21:48 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Forget it.
[12/29/17, 1:35:06 AM] Maitreya Naik: http://edition.cnn.com/2017/05/14/opinions/what-explains-the-universes-cold-spot-lincoln/index.html


I was reading this
[12/29/17, 1:35:24 AM] Maitreya Naik: And this has more addendum to the same
[12/29/17, 1:40:25 AM] Maitreya Naik: I think I get the spot that you are looking for. But I'm trying to figure out all the conditions. Seems like you are looking for lack of external sensory perception, - light, gravity, heat. And only experience the internal workings of your body. The air in your lungs, the blood through your veins
[12/29/17, 1:40:36 AM] Maitreya Naik: And trying to find out if such a location can exist
[12/29/17, 1:42:05 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Haha I just wanna know if there can exist a place where light can't get to it (or hasn't got to it yet) ONLY because the place is so far away from everything. Not because of light being blocked because of eclipses and all.
[12/29/17, 1:42:59 AM] Maitreya Naik: 👍🏽
[12/29/17, 1:44:03 AM] Maitreya Naik: Well then the question would be. Wouldn't such a place eventually receive light unless it is absorbed by a black hole or similar cold spots?
Suggesting that the point of your interest may exist over the edge of the universe?
[12/29/17, 1:44:19 AM] Maitreya Naik: Because funny thing is what is the "edge"?
[12/29/17, 1:44:39 AM] Maitreya Naik: Perceptible waves of any wavelength? Visible or not?
[12/29/17, 1:47:00 AM] Maitreya Naik: https://amp.space.com/33005-where-is-the-universes-edge-op-ed.html
[12/29/17, 2:13:24 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Would it have to? How fast is the universe expanding again? I forgot. If it's faster than the speed of light, it theoretically wouldn't receive any light ever, correct ?
[12/29/17, 2:13:43 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Maybe everything apart from cmbr
[12/29/17, 2:14:37 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Coz everything appears to be moving away from you no matter where you are in the universe
[12/29/17, 2:14:46 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: (I forget why Andromeda doesn't do that)
[12/29/17, 2:21:17 AM] Maitreya Naik: Exactly! Defining an "edge" isn't clear yet. Maybe there is no edge. If there's one, it may be 4 dimensional since we are already expanding a surface which is 3 dimensional
[12/29/17, 2:22:14 AM] Maitreya Naik: Before we get to the speed of expansion, let's clarify that given the fact that the expansion is visible from any point in the universe, we have to consider the speed in a relative manner
[12/29/17, 2:23:29 AM] Maitreya Naik: technically, particles closer to a point of perception (the center of an expansion) move away slower than the points farther away
[12/29/17, 2:24:45 AM] Maitreya Naik: Given that info, looking up numbers on great Google across a few sources, the speed of expansion of the universe seems to be about 68km/sec/megaparsec
[12/29/17, 2:26:22 AM] Maitreya Naik: Meaning that a galaxy 1megaparsec (3.3 Mn Lightyears) away from us is perceived to recede at 68km/s from us
[12/29/17, 2:26:38 AM] Maitreya Naik: 2 Megaparsec, 136km/s
[12/29/17, 2:26:43 AM] Maitreya Naik: Blah blah
[12/29/17, 2:27:48 AM] Maitreya Naik: So there should be a galaxy far far away (😉) from a light source that recedes faster than 3x10^5 km/s from the light source
[12/29/17, 2:28:39 AM] Maitreya Naik: Hence if you want to find a spot that is perennially in darkness, it has to be that distance away from its nearest light source
[12/29/17, 2:55:32 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Nice
[12/29/17, 2:55:59 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: So, gravity notwithstanding, this is possible
[12/29/17, 2:56:45 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Oops, I used notwithstanding wrong. 
Without considering gravity * this is possible.
[12/29/17, 3:09:25 AM] Maitreya Naik: Yupp
[12/29/17, 3:23:13 AM] Maitreya Naik: Theoretically
[12/29/17, 3:23:17 AM] Maitreya Naik: But that's a huge distance
[12/29/17, 4:06:13 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It is
[12/29/17, 4:06:31 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: But we don't know so much. (this makes me happy)
[12/29/17, 4:09:12 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: (apologies for all the spam I've caused :p)
[12/29/17, 5:11:22 AM] Maitreya Naik: 😂
[12/29/17, 5:54:29 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: If “the universe” is defined as all matter and energy, and if by “expanding” you mean all this matter and energy is just spreading farther into an infinite vacuum, then you can always go beyond the reaches of this defined “universe” into a vacuum that hasn’t yet seen any of this matter or energy right?
[12/29/17, 5:59:13 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: This takes us back to the edge thing.
[12/29/17, 5:59:43 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Sorry, I shall read the entire conversation :P
[12/29/17, 6:01:44 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Lol good luck
[12/29/17, 6:03:02 AM] Maitreya Naik: Ya. Exactly the point
[12/29/17, 6:20:26 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: <‎image omitted>
[12/29/17, 6:21:05 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Hahaha
[12/29/17, 6:44:24 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Mm I haven't read any of the sources cited above yet so I might say dumb things but uh since the number of light sources is finite and the objects in space positioned arbitrarily, there should be a non zero probability of existence of infinitely many points or components in space that have never seen light but will see light at some point, with a non zero probability. 

Also isn't necessary that universe expands faster than speed of light, that assumes everything in the universe has seen light and we require a new component in space that hasn't. But that beautiful beautiful point by @14129614621 made me wake up. :D

@14129612581 "the universe"?! whaaaaayyyy! Now I no longer know what the universe meansss!!!! 

@14129547000 Naice! Loved the discussion :D
[12/29/17, 6:48:27 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: http://tcrn.ch/2DtUHB3
[12/29/17, 6:48:44 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: So I'm motion planning, you talk something about "coverage": when I drop a point in the space, call it A, can every point in the space be reached by a straight line from A? Since there are obstacles, this isn't possible. But if I drop enough points, this should be possible and I have complete coverage which means with these points as "milestones", I can plan from any point to any other point using simple straight lines. Your problem is similar :D
[12/29/17, 6:49:39 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: SoftBank is becoming the new Google :o
[12/29/17, 7:47:42 AM] Maitreya Naik: You assume that the universe is finite enough to have light from some point to have reached every other point. Which isn't correct
[12/29/17, 7:48:43 AM] Maitreya Naik: There's no proof or disproof to that assumption
[12/29/17, 7:58:45 AM] Maitreya Naik: The comparison to the UN Security Council is pretty funny
[12/29/17, 7:58:57 AM] Maitreya Naik: Oh ya. Didn't we talk about this?
[12/29/17, 8:09:53 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Yup
[12/29/17, 8:10:35 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Also I forgot to take into account points that have received light at some point but stopped receiving light forever.
[12/29/17, 8:11:10 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Can those exist ? I think they can. Just holes in space where there's nothing. Not black holes, those are different.
[12/29/17, 8:11:18 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Hmm.
[12/29/17, 8:11:32 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I wish I knew the right set of words to google exactly what I have in mind.
[12/29/17, 8:11:42 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I loved it too!
[12/29/17, 8:13:03 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Yeah 😂
[12/29/17, 8:30:02 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: No I don't, i just leave for the uncertainty by speaking in probabilities
[12/29/17, 9:43:10 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: People staying in Pitts, I have a dresser to give away, if anyone needs it we can haul it over to yours on 31st
[12/29/17, 9:45:50 AM] Shivam Gupta: Send to NY

[12/29/17, 9:49:48 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Haha I know I know :D
[12/29/17, 11:12:41 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: So I just rewatched Jack Reacher - it's based in Pitt. It was freaky lol. In one scene there's a bus headed to squirrel hill :p
[12/30/17, 9:57:23 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Jumanji is AMAZING
[12/30/17, 9:57:30 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I'm midway and I'm laughing so much

[12/30/17, 10:06:42 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: And the whole game thing - I'm loving it hahaha
[12/30/17, 11:10:43 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: 10/10 will watch again hahaha
[12/31/17, 8:00:24 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: So none staying in Pitts wants a free dresser?
[12/31/17, 8:00:38 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: <‎image omitted>
[12/31/17, 8:00:50 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: It's free free freeeee

[12/31/17, 8:03:19 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I don't mind giving it away to any of your friends either. I just want it to have a new home :)
[12/31/17, 8:09:51 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Just cuz u guys got jobs, so much attitude towards free stuff now huh? 😒😑😛
[12/31/17, 8:10:33 AM] Koushik Bhavani: The only people who are going to be in Pitts with jobs is Aum and Mai
[12/31/17, 8:10:43 AM] Koushik Bhavani: And they aren’t here
[12/31/17, 8:10:47 AM] Koushik Bhavani: So shut up :p
[12/31/17, 8:11:13 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Put it in Pittsburgh Indian group. You'll get money also
[12/31/17, 8:11:21 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: What's that?
[12/31/17, 8:11:28 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Can you put link?

[1/1/18, 9:56:30 PM] Maitreya Naik: Tips on what to do between Bellandur and Indiranagar?
[1/1/18, 9:56:47 PM] Maitreya Naik: Should I just go to Indiranagar?
[1/1/18, 9:57:11 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Idk, not my domain
[1/1/18, 9:57:28 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: What do you mean? :P
[1/1/18, 9:57:32 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: JP Nagar / Jayanagar / Sahakarnagar are the areas I know

[1/1/18, 10:49:13 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Have fun tomorrow also
[1/1/18, 10:49:16 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: :p
[1/1/18, 10:49:35 PM] Maitreya Naik: Oh no. What happened?

[1/2/18, 1:46:45 AM] Shruti Rijhwani: I think it's Gautam's fabulous phone
[1/2/18, 1:47:08 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: ❤
[1/2/18, 1:47:35 AM] Shruti Rijhwani: Such a nice photo! Can we make you the official photographer for Funday Sunday?
[1/2/18, 1:48:24 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: I'm already the official photographer for funday Sunday 😬
[1/2/18, 7:27:30 AM] Koushik Bhavani: Definitely not
[1/2/18, 7:27:36 AM] Koushik Bhavani: It’s the people :)
[1/2/18, 7:27:46 AM] Koushik Bhavani: And it’s Bangalore yo
[1/2/18, 10:43:55 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Do any of you know if the final electricity bill for your place matters? I'm shutting down my account with Duquesne light and they are asking me where to send the final bill
[1/2/18, 10:44:13 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I'm 90% sure it doesn't matter coz I'll have an e-copy anyway, I think
[1/2/18, 10:44:22 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: But if any of you think otherwise, lemme know!
[1/2/18, 10:45:02 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Nvm, I found another solution

[1/4/18, 6:17:34 AM] Koushik Bhavani: Such games nice
[1/4/18, 6:19:00 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: Is this looks battleship?
[1/4/18, 6:19:03 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: *like
[1/4/18, 6:19:30 AM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: Yess
[1/4/18, 6:19:49 AM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: Only that when you blow up a part of the ship you need to drink the shot
[1/4/18, 6:21:49 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: Remember how we tried to make codenames a drinking game with similar rules? 😂
[1/4/18, 6:23:19 AM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: Yeah😂
[1/4/18, 6:40:35 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/technology/self-driving-cars-aurora.html
[1/4/18, 7:29:39 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Dhoni is officially back to CSK 💛
[1/4/18, 7:37:43 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I think I'd heard about this! Really cool
[1/4/18, 7:44:42 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: This may be a stupid question, I'm an ML / NN noob:
Can driverless cars be programmed to drive in particular styles? 

For instance, mild mode sets it to drive like someone normal, mild mannered, an average person driving through the city.

And sports mode sets it to drive like a pro. Or like a street racer :p 

Obviously not practical, but in my head, I see this as being one of the key plot points of a sci fi book series :p it'd be so cool. 

Imagine a black market deal going down:

"This car? It's special. It drives like Brian O'Connor (or even, say, Baby Driver). $1 mil. Cold hard cash. Unmarked bills, 20s only". 

I also am imagining trench coat wearing individuals doing the deal in the rain in an alleyway at about 8:27 pm in Chicago.
[1/4/18, 7:45:26 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Wow, that really went away from where it started.
[1/4/18, 7:46:13 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Clearly you are on Web WhatsApp
[1/4/18, 7:46:22 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Hahaha, no I'm on my phone.
[1/4/18, 7:46:28 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: :o
[1/4/18, 7:49:04 AM] Aum Jadhav: Very much possible. Not sure how this would work in an end-to-end learning paradigm, but in a more traditional AV stack there are tons of parameters that can be optimized to change driving behavior. This is basically a more complicated form of the various driving modes you already get on some cars.
[1/4/18, 7:49:27 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: AV?
[1/4/18, 7:49:37 AM] Aum Jadhav: Autonomous Vehicles
[1/4/18, 7:49:40 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Audio visual?
[1/4/18, 7:49:40 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Ah
[1/4/18, 7:49:42 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Lel
[1/4/18, 7:49:59 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Interesting.
[1/4/18, 7:50:10 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I should just write off a chapter of a book that uses it
[1/4/18, 7:50:16 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Just for my satisfaction
[1/4/18, 7:50:28 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Then maybe one day I can animate it and put it online and make money.
[1/4/18, 7:50:31 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: #thedream
[1/4/18, 7:50:35 AM] Aum Jadhav: As for the trench coat mafia deals, it’d be much easier to get a normal car with a skilled driver 😝
[1/4/18, 7:51:16 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Hehe, so my book is gonna have to explain why what you said isn't possible.
[1/4/18, 7:51:22 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Hmmmm
[1/4/18, 7:52:35 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Anca Dragan at UCB actually works on something similar where she models _human_ drivers to enable AV to dynamically change behaviors accordingly. If you are driving crazy like koushik for instance, the vehicle would probably steer clear. I would see the "driving modes" to naturally evolve out of this work.
[1/4/18, 7:52:59 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Nice!
[1/4/18, 7:53:00 AM] Koushik Bhavani: I don’t drive crazy :p
[1/4/18, 7:53:02 AM] Koushik Bhavani: But I
[1/4/18, 7:53:03 AM] Koushik Bhavani: Ok
[1/4/18, 7:53:09 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: XD
[1/4/18, 7:53:14 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: As for the trench coat mafia, I'd probably like them to be robots selling human drivers and betting on them.
[1/4/18, 7:53:15 AM] Aum Jadhav: Liez
[1/4/18, 7:53:24 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: OOOHHHHHHHHH
[1/4/18, 7:53:31 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I didn't mean to caps that
[1/4/18, 7:53:31 AM] Koushik Bhavani: Hehe :)
[1/4/18, 7:54:04 AM] Koushik Bhavani: Sunil I think you should write novels
[1/4/18, 7:54:06 AM] Koushik Bhavani: For sure
[1/4/18, 7:54:20 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Dude I've tried
[1/4/18, 7:54:22 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It's so hard
[1/4/18, 7:54:24 AM] Koushik Bhavani: You have so much patience to type such big messages
[1/4/18, 7:54:31 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Hahahaha
[1/4/18, 7:54:35 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I type pretty fast, Da
[1/4/18, 7:54:53 AM] Aum Jadhav: Shamelessly publicizing your lab’s alumni. Tch tch
[1/4/18, 7:55:11 AM] Koushik Bhavani: 😂
[1/4/18, 7:55:13 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Also, Dragan. Such a cool last name.
[1/4/18, 7:55:22 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Haha :P
[1/4/18, 7:56:01 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: She should make a car company and call it Dragan.
[1/4/18, 7:56:05 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Aw man.
[1/4/18, 7:56:11 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: So awesome that would be
[1/4/18, 7:56:49 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Has *_anyone_* here read 'Supernaturalist' by Eoin Colfer? (The Artemis Fowl author)
[1/4/18, 7:57:03 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It has one of the best race sequences ever.
[1/4/18, 7:57:35 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: This car - fabled to be the best ever - uses nitrous for fuel :p it's called the Myishi Z6
[1/4/18, 7:57:51 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: And I'm not looking this up, I remember this from before 10th grade. I loved that car that much hahaha
[1/4/18, 7:58:51 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: If my fanboying is bothering anyone, pliss to tell me to silence. I will oblige.
[1/4/18, 7:58:53 AM] Aum Jadhav: That’s physicality impossible. Nitrous is just an oxidizing agent, not fuel.
[1/4/18, 7:59:02 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Hahahah I know
[1/4/18, 7:59:07 AM] Aum Jadhav: Physically *
[1/4/18, 7:59:22 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: If I remember he explained how it worked
[1/4/18, 7:59:36 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Or he didn't and I was just like 'OMFG THIS CAR IS SO COOL'
[1/4/18, 7:59:45 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Possibly the latter.
[1/4/18, 7:59:58 AM] Aum Jadhav: Lol
[1/4/18, 8:00:01 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Wait lemme check
[1/4/18, 8:01:40 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: The group is muted, knock yourself out :P
[1/4/18, 8:02:39 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: <‎image omitted>
[1/4/18, 8:02:55 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Also, shit it's the Myishi Z12. Dammit.
[1/4/18, 8:03:10 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It does have 6 wheels though.
[1/4/18, 8:04:12 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Nope. Nope. That's wrong too. It has 4 wheels. The opponent's has 6 wheels.
[1/4/18, 8:04:19 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Time to reread it :D
[1/4/18, 8:06:10 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: "the Z12 shot forward like Thor's Hammer across the sky" 😍
[1/4/18, 8:09:14 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I'll stop now :p
[1/4/18, 8:21:28 AM] Koushik Bhavani: Not everyone Gautam :/
[1/4/18, 8:52:15 AM] Maitreya Naik: Yes. I enjoyed it. Just thought he could have improved the ending.
Also The Wish List is so good!!!
[1/4/18, 8:54:00 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I haven't read wish list
[1/4/18, 8:54:09 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Airman was amazing
[1/4/18, 8:54:13 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It almost made me cry.
[1/4/18, 8:54:20 AM] Maitreya Naik: Now you know what to read too
[1/4/18, 8:54:26 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Lol
[1/4/18, 8:54:34 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Have you read Lockwood and co?
[1/4/18, 8:54:39 AM] Maitreya Naik: Same about the crying 😢😢
[1/4/18, 8:54:54 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Jonathan Stroud
[1/4/18, 8:54:59 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Not Colfer
[1/4/18, 8:54:59 AM] Maitreya Naik: No. Is that by Colfer too?
[1/4/18, 8:55:09 AM] Maitreya Naik: Ah
[1/4/18, 8:55:13 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It's amazing. Read it off.

[1/17/18, 9:22:11 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Woah yeah that's high
[1/17/18, 9:22:12 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: And generally how many hours per week are working?
[1/17/18, 9:22:31 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Avk is super rich. What do you think?
[1/17/18, 9:22:40 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: 😒
[1/17/18, 9:22:57 AM] Maitreya Naik: 😂
[1/17/18, 9:23:19 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I calculated assuming 20 hours a week. I think that's the rule for part time no?
[1/17/18, 9:23:40 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: Yup
[1/17/18, 9:23:55 AM] Maitreya Naik: Yes
[1/17/18, 9:24:17 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: UW gives the same. So I think most schools have ~similar pay for RA. Stanford as well although cost of living is insane there.
[1/17/18, 9:24:35 AM] Maitreya Naik: UW has gates money, right? :P
[1/17/18, 9:24:57 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Yess he just donated shit tones yet again :P
[1/17/18, 9:25:43 AM] Maitreya Naik: These salaries may be true for such high donation receiving private universities. Not so much for other state universities
[1/17/18, 9:26:12 AM] Maitreya Naik: Unless you're an assistant to the coach of a USC or OSU football team, I suppose 😂
[1/17/18, 9:26:28 AM] Maitreya Naik: Then you may be swimming in money probably
[1/17/18, 9:27:00 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Haha cool thanks!
[1/17/18, 9:29:43 AM] Maitreya Naik: *UMich or OSU
To be consistent with mentioning state universities
[1/17/18, 10:17:38 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Anyone knows good/legit resources/channels to learn basketball skills?

[1/21/18, 10:08:47 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Guess they are pretty confident it'll work seamlessly
[1/21/18, 10:58:30 AM] Michael RI: That's so cokl
[1/21/18, 10:58:48 AM] Michael RI: I wonder when they start putting them up elsewhere

[1/22/18, 6:19:50 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: But there's a new bill aiming to increase it to $90000
[1/22/18, 8:28:05 PM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: There is a limit?
[1/22/18, 8:31:59 PM] Koushik Bhavani: Haan it should be above that

[1/23/18, 1:24:55 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: California?
[1/23/18, 1:25:00 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: California?
[1/23/18, 1:25:16 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I am right next to Canada and you ask California people to be safe?

[1/24/18, 7:33:48 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: You get points for picking the right answer, and points for misleading others into picking yours

[1/28/18, 6:42:06 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: @14122189525 @12144055438 I am reading this paper on Autonomous  Driving that states people use RRTs?
[1/28/18, 6:42:24 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I would assume them being probabilistic is a huge nono?
[1/28/18, 8:41:23 PM] Aum Jadhav: Thanks everyone! 😊
[1/28/18, 8:43:21 PM] Aum Jadhav: nuTonomy uses a modified RRT* apparently (for obvious reasons). Not sure how they actually implement that, but haven’t heard of anyone else taking similar approaches.
[1/29/18, 2:22:57 PM] Aum Jadhav: For those still in smoky India...

[2/6/18, 12:29:49 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: And how is it as a company?
[2/6/18, 1:08:14 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: <‎image omitted>
[2/6/18, 1:08:48 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Nice shirt! :D
[2/6/18, 1:09:29 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: No idea, sorry. Gautam’s company is a different electric car company, so he may know
[2/7/18, 6:28:56 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: why does Elon Musk think going to Mars will save humanity?
[2/7/18, 6:29:05 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Is that the goal or am I getting it all wrong?
[2/7/18, 6:29:57 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: The Earth is going to become unlivable at some point in this century or next, at the current rate
[2/7/18, 6:30:23 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: (If there’s no major technological breakthrough that can change that)
[2/7/18, 6:31:17 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: http://tcrn.ch/2FXb4aB
[2/7/18, 6:31:27 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: ^ Unrelated
[2/7/18, 6:31:50 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Hmm. So let's go ruin another planet?
[2/7/18, 6:33:43 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: And I think this is becoming significantly debatable
[2/7/18, 6:34:04 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Perhaps it was not a few years ago, but the scenario is becoming more optimistic now
[2/7/18, 6:34:47 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: If we grow at the rate we are we either exhaust all our resources and hence sustainable tech like Tesla, or the sustainable tech won't be enough so destroy the planet trying to survive, therefore a backup plan.
[2/7/18, 6:37:11 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Ah I see
[2/7/18, 7:53:10 PM] Michael RI: I think it's more that any planet has the chance of a catastrophic event like an asteroid strike or a supervolcano exploding, having humans on another planet exponentially I creases chance for survival. I don't believe that the majority of people who want to colonize mars think that the earth is used up or not worth keeping alive
[2/7/18, 8:08:23 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Hm so have numerous options instead of one in case of a cataclysmic event?
[2/7/18, 8:14:11 PM] Michael RI: Yup, if an asteroid destroyed life on earth, mars could be the seed to repopulate, being multiplanetary has security in the redundancy
[2/7/18, 8:15:20 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: That’s definitely a good reason. But I definitely also believe that without an alternate sustainable energy source, the Earth is going to be hard to live in for more than a dozen decades or so at most
[2/8/18, 12:14:59 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: I agree. There is so much to do on Earth, so much to improve. Skewed distribution of resources, inequality of opportunities, (un)availability of education, biased and manipulative media are the reasons why people might think that the Earth is "saturating".
[2/8/18, 12:21:14 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: In all his s craziness, Musk is pragmatic. His companies are labs where major improvements are germinating (solar, electric cars, etc..) while back-up plans are slowing being put in place (Mars)
[2/8/18, 12:24:02 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: Also, don't forget that Musk, as well as, Bezos lived before the internet as we now know it. But they did not have to worry about the infrastructure; dozens or companies before them had tried and succeeded at it, creating an ecosystem that was ripe for growth
[2/8/18, 12:25:04 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: Musk and Bezos both want to enable the same kind of growth in space. They're spending their time and money so that other can build on top of their success.
[2/8/18, 12:27:28 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: Finally, Musk is a business man. He knows that advanced technology development decants to the mainstream with potential for profit, that economies of scale improve margins, that throwing a Roadster in space means publicity for SpaceX *and* Tesla *and* him.
[2/8/18, 12:28:38 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: Passion, Skill, Values, Hope. That's why he's shooting for Mars.
[2/8/18, 12:53:35 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: I almost forgot that he's also sending the (very explicit message) that Earth's problems are everyone's responsibility.
[2/8/18, 12:54:17 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: Powerwalls in Puerto Rico, virtual solar grid in Australia, *Made on Earth by humans* in space.
[2/8/18, 12:58:04 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: Also, he's trying to show (mainly the American people) that the DoD (budget: $600bn) and NASA (budget: $20bn) aren't the only ones capable of great things; and that great things don't have to be linked to militarism.

[2/8/18, 6:58:11 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Whose marketing material is that?
[2/8/18, 7:58:54 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Has anyone started on tax work this year? Help me please! I don't know where to start
[2/8/18, 8:19:58 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: MIC - it's an org.
[2/8/18, 8:54:31 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: 👍🏾
[2/8/18, 11:02:20 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: Sorry, MIC is the program. IVAW is the org.
[2/9/18, 1:33:16 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: EE people! I would like to learn about FPGAs, and given that I do not know jack about any of the preliminaries either, is there a book you'd suggest I pick up. More readable the better..! Thanks a lot!
[2/9/18, 7:16:12 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: JP had some amazing advice on that^. Thanks!

[2/16/18, 12:21:43 PM] Prithvi Shankar: I got group on
[2/16/18, 12:23:31 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Anyway a stock will be what a 5-10$? That's not an incentive at all. What's the sell for the service?

I didn't really feel like putting this up, earlier, but then I figured I should. 
This happened at my company yesterday. I was lucky enough to keep my internship, but my entire team (including my supervisor and his boss) were laid off / transferred. Without notice. Nobody saw it coming. We had our regular morning meeting and then they pulled me into a huge meeting consisting of around half the studio, and fired/transferred everyone else. I realised I should share this with you all to remind you -
1. ALWAYS keep saving money
2. Don't forget that OPT is flexible, H1B is not. 
3. This sorta thing keeps happening here apparently, so if you feel down because of all of this, look to your support system. It's not the end of the world. 

(I'm writing this message for myself too, for when this inevitably happens to me in the future and I'm equally inevitably going to be depressed with everything)
[2/16/18, 9:05:48 PM] Prithvi Shankar: Tough times.
[2/17/18, 6:52:19 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: i hope interested people are watching the slam dunk contest

[2/17/18, 6:52:43 PM] Koushik Bhavani: I am not watching though

[2/17/18, 7:57:42 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Have you people tried this app called HQ?
[2/17/18, 7:58:29 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: It's a trivia challenge. Everyday at 3pm and 9 pm you try and answer 12 questions
[2/17/18, 7:58:46 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Those who can, win money
[2/17/18, 7:59:03 PM] Prithvi Shankar: Yeah. We did it together in Florida 😂
[2/17/18, 7:59:10 PM] Prithvi Shankar: Nupur wasn't impressed

[2/17/18, 7:59:18 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: It's fun
[2/17/18, 9:18:25 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: We googled shit pretty fast actually. Didn't work for long 😅
[2/17/18, 9:46:22 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Yeah I'm sure you can do that
[2/17/18, 9:46:37 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I was also thinking of how one could write a program for it
[2/17/18, 10:05:23 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: How do you people watch Indian movies here?
[2/17/18, 10:05:52 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: As in if there are specific ones you want to watch which are not in theatres here
[2/17/18, 10:17:22 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: @16464921633 knows all the shady websites
[2/17/18, 10:25:18 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: indian movies, I generally try movierulz
[2/17/18, 10:25:51 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: it's pretty good, lets you load subtitles also if it's not a languagge you understand

[2/18/18, 7:00:01 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Not sure
[2/19/18, 10:19:17 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: It took me 4 hours to find a bug and understand that in python, comparisons `a is b` and `a == b` are not always the same. Sigh.
[2/19/18, 10:28:37 PM] Maitreya Naik: Bummer. Could have referenced you to a source
[2/19/18, 10:28:49 PM] Maitreya Naik: May have objectively helped you identify the difference
[2/19/18, 10:29:10 PM] Maitreya Naik: Maybe you got the same content from a different location
[2/19/18, 10:31:34 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: @14129612581 remember this? :P

[2/19/18, 11:54:11 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Punny Bouy hahaha
[2/19/18, 11:57:23 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Shit I hadn't got that. Nice. There's many references I don't get. 😏

Great movie. Don't miss it.
[2/22/18, 6:25:51 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: (I watched it twice in two days)
[2/22/18, 9:24:18 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: If anyone watches X-Files, expect HERB to feature on 28th! Our boy's debut in the TV industry :)
[2/22/18, 9:25:46 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I don't but wow exciting! So Herb went over to Seattle with you?
[2/22/18, 9:26:27 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Oh yes! We had CMU pay for all the parts, build him there and brought him here
[2/22/18, 9:26:33 PM] Koushik Bhavani: Nice 😬
[2/22/18, 9:26:39 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: That was how we bid farewell to CMU 😛
[2/22/18, 9:30:58 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Wow. He kept the name though? Good tribute 🤓
[2/22/18, 9:32:05 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Name's too popular to change no? Sticks :D
[2/22/18, 9:32:47 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Also the one good thing about Black Panther is their album. All the Stars(?) ❤️
[2/22/18, 9:46:59 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Only one good thing?
[2/22/18, 9:47:57 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Movie was okay..I checked my watch a couple of times 😶
[2/22/18, 9:52:59 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: The best part was when someone screamed at Prithvi for taking in the theatre 😂
[2/22/18, 9:53:07 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Talking*
[2/22/18, 9:55:29 PM] Koushik Bhavani: lolz
[2/22/18, 9:56:48 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: That and the strong female characters. And everyone's accents. And the story (not its pace) and how it sets things up beautifully.
[2/22/18, 10:02:43 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I'm pretty psyched up for infinity war now. I hope it doesn't let me down. But I guess it's best to assume it will.
[2/22/18, 10:02:56 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Lesser heartache that way
[2/23/18, 12:28:22 PM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: Anyone?
[2/23/18, 12:51:54 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: I think you contact CMUWorks and request them to mail you the W2 forms
[2/23/18, 12:52:24 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: https://www.cmu.edu/cmuworks/announcements/2018/02_01_18_Understanding_W2.html
[2/23/18, 12:52:56 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: And you also have to contact your employer from your summer internship for tax forms, if I’m not wrong
[2/23/18, 1:16:55 PM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: Yeah, I want to know what to do after that😅
[2/23/18, 1:17:59 PM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: Basically what other form  (104/104 EZ/8xxx?) And which online service is good?
[2/23/18, 1:25:18 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Form 8843
[2/23/18, 1:25:49 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: And this year also the 1040NR-EZ, I think
[2/23/18, 1:26:02 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Do it yourself :P
[2/23/18, 1:29:17 PM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: I'm lazy to even googe, you think I'll do it myself :P
[2/23/18, 1:29:34 PM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: Google*
[2/23/18, 1:30:03 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: You’ll end up filling everything yourself and paying them to do it, might as well just ask someone who’s already done it to help you :P
[2/23/18, 2:02:05 PM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: No no, some of them are free
[2/23/18, 2:24:52 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Taxes 😩 I haven't started yet...
[2/23/18, 2:25:25 PM] Maitreya Naik: Lol. Will you receive a money order from the IRS?
[2/23/18, 2:25:34 PM] Maitreya Naik: ^
[2/23/18, 2:25:47 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Oh okay. Let us know if you find one
[2/23/18, 2:26:54 PM] Maitreya Naik: Lmk
[2/23/18, 2:27:07 PM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: You guys are supposed to tell me that
[2/23/18, 2:27:20 PM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: 😑
[2/23/18, 2:28:20 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: 😅
[2/23/18, 2:28:29 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: I still have a US bank account you know :P
[2/23/18, 2:28:40 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Same here
[2/23/18, 2:29:05 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Me too
[2/23/18, 2:29:07 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Does the government know? :P
[2/23/18, 2:31:29 PM] Aum Jadhav: Okay so I recently found out that the IRS has a Volunteer tax assistance program. You can basically go to a center with your tax documents and they'll help you file. They're all over the country and you're eligible as long as you were poor last year (i.e. income <$54k) or old.
https://www.irs.gov/individuals/free-tax-return-preparation-for-you-by-volunteers
[2/23/18, 2:31:45 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Lol, I'm lucky WhatsApp encrypts all conversations
[2/23/18, 2:33:25 PM] Aum Jadhav: Or you can try to do it yourself by going through the course
https://apps.irs.gov/app/vita/foreign_student.jsp?level=
[2/23/18, 2:34:37 PM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: That's gross income. It won't apply to us
[2/23/18, 2:35:06 PM] Maitreya Naik: Did you earn more than $54k?
[2/23/18, 2:35:19 PM] Aum Jadhav: How much did you actually make during your 3-month internship?! :O
[2/23/18, 2:35:41 PM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: My bad
[2/23/18, 2:35:59 PM] Aum Jadhav: Raees log
[2/23/18, 2:36:09 PM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: See Sanjay you gave use wrong info
[2/23/18, 3:08:31 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Sorry 😐
[2/23/18, 11:25:42 PM] Maitreya Naik: Only a few marvel movies have good soundtracks. They could have used it better in this one.

However, I will PM you some points which may make you reconsider your experience of the movie, owing to not revealing too much about the movie for those who haven't seen it.

It is a beautifully told story for everyone to watch.
[2/23/18, 11:26:37 PM] Maitreya Naik: The soundtrack is so amazing. Definitely could have been used better. But it was still well used

[2/24/18, 8:16:27 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Oh okay :D
[2/24/18, 8:16:52 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Is there more tomatoes/less meat than usual, or is it just the camera?
[2/24/18, 8:22:39 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: It's the camera, for sure

[2/25/18, 6:58:53 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Cards against humanity, codenames, coup and mafia

[2/25/18, 8:51:59 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: https://youtu.be/fiBLgEx6svA

Juxtapose. And also, 'Forget me nots' is funny to me because of the neuralizer in MIB (it modifies your memory)
[2/25/18, 8:52:32 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: And that was the usual, useless, factoid of the day from yours truly. 

Peace.
[2/25/18, 9:03:37 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I was praised more for my gameplay than were the winners. Jussayin 😋

[3/2/18, 10:10:00 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Help! A company is asking me:
Do you currently hold an EAD card? (answered yes).
If yes, is the EAD for a STEM extension?
[3/2/18, 10:10:25 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Does this mean "Are you currently in the STEM extension period?" or "Can you ever get STEM extension?"
[3/2/18, 10:10:51 AM] Aum Jadhav: Most probably the former
[3/2/18, 10:13:03 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Ohh okay thanks
[3/2/18, 10:14:59 AM] Prithvi Shankar: +1
[3/2/18, 10:15:55 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: So I answered No for it, since I'm not on STEM extension
[3/2/18, 10:16:18 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: And what do I put as the expiration date of my current status? The one mentioned on my visa?
[3/2/18, 10:16:33 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Or the one on the EAD card?
[3/2/18, 10:16:51 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Can you send a screenshot of the form?
[3/2/18, 10:17:00 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Does it say F1 visa is the status
[3/2/18, 10:18:28 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: <‎image omitted>
[3/2/18, 10:19:29 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Maybe I should just give them all the dates
[3/2/18, 10:19:30 AM] Prithvi Shankar: I'm guessing it's Ead expiration since they've specified F1/Ead/opt on top
[3/2/18, 10:19:36 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Ahh okay
[3/2/18, 10:19:43 AM] Prithvi Shankar: If it's a text box, just go for it 😅

[3/4/18, 11:48:42 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Okay that might not be it, but it's one of the faster routes Maps is showing
[3/4/18, 11:49:24 AM] Koushik Bhavani: I think you just rent a car and come
[3/4/18, 11:50:11 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Hahah I should get the driver's license fastly
[3/4/18, 11:50:26 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I'll apply once I get my EAD card
[3/4/18, 11:51:10 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: :O Why don't you guys come over here and we'll go to Mt Tamalpais?
[3/4/18, 11:51:51 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I've always wanted to go after realizing I read about it in Percy Jackson and it's literally directly in front of my hotel.
[3/4/18, 11:58:21 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: OR.
[3/4/18, 11:58:22 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: OR.

[3/4/18, 12:18:24 PM] Prithvi Shankar: Been there already 🙈
[3/4/18, 12:18:49 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: There's 2 here
[3/4/18, 12:19:15 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Surely you've not been to both
[3/4/18, 12:19:36 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Even if you have, you've not gone there with us, so it's a completely new experience.
[3/4/18, 12:45:26 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I'm (finally) applying for a credit card. How did you answer the question of the assets that are available to you?
[3/4/18, 12:49:58 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: I just put in the i20 amount
[3/4/18, 12:50:13 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Everyone I know has put in different random numbers in there 😂
[3/4/18, 12:50:28 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Hahaha okay thanks
[3/4/18, 12:51:01 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: So for Discover I was not asked documents to show my assets
[3/4/18, 12:51:49 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: For a stupid ass capital one card I put a number too high and they asked me for docs to prove
[3/4/18, 12:52:06 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: So as long as your numbers are reasonable they won't care much
[3/4/18, 12:56:41 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: 😳 okay
[3/4/18, 1:04:32 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Discover asks for this? I don't remember putting that
[3/4/18, 1:04:46 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Ah they do
[3/4/18, 1:04:55 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Hi Avk
[3/4/18, 1:05:02 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Hi Shrutzee
[3/4/18, 1:05:28 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Been so long I don't remember your face anymore 💔

[3/4/18, 1:06:49 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Your forgotten friends @14129616423
[3/4/18, 1:09:05 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Sigh
[3/4/18, 1:09:11 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: How long does it take to build up a credit score?
[3/4/18, 1:09:14 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I thought Sid has glasses now
[3/4/18, 1:09:18 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: 6 mo
[3/4/18, 1:09:22 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: 6 months
[3/4/18, 1:09:34 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Ah okay
[3/4/18, 1:10:06 PM] Maitreya Naik: I out in I-20 stuff too
[3/4/18, 1:10:30 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Shruti is handing over Discover referrals like crazyyy
[3/4/18, 1:10:39 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: How much did you get from these referrals?
[3/4/18, 1:10:57 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: how did you know aditi used mine? :O
[3/4/18, 1:11:20 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Pfft obvious :P
[3/4/18, 1:11:41 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Didn't she?
[3/4/18, 1:12:27 PM] Maitreya Naik: First credit score is available after 2 months
[3/4/18, 1:13:17 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: So do I start getting credit reports in 6 months? Or I get those immediately?
[3/4/18, 1:13:46 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: I got after 6 months
[3/4/18, 1:16:45 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Cool cool thanks!
[3/4/18, 1:16:50 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Oh wait conflilcting info
[3/4/18, 1:16:51 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: *
[3/4/18, 1:16:52 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Let's see what I get
[3/4/18, 1:17:02 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: So. This is what you do. Apply for a credit card. Get it approved. Start using it. Meanwhile download this app called credit karma which tracks your credit card and gives you free Equifax and TransUnion credit scores. I still think it'll take a couple of months at the least for the score to show up but you can check your score for free over multiple account on the app and manage your score better when it comes up.
[3/4/18, 1:18:02 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Discover also lets you check your FICO score for free but doesn't let you analyze or manage over multiple accounts nicely.
[3/4/18, 1:19:50 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Perfect, thanks! I'll get the app
[3/4/18, 1:25:58 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: 👍☺️
[3/4/18, 1:37:52 PM] Maitreya Naik: Ya. You will see the predicted score starting 2 months. But I had 2 cards within a month. One of them a PNC. Maybe that's why the prediction came in earlier?
[3/4/18, 1:40:26 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: I didn't know about this app 🙁
[3/4/18, 1:41:08 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: ah okay
[3/4/18, 1:41:22 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Where we meeting at 8?
[3/4/18, 2:21:56 PM] Koushik Bhavani: San Jose 😬
[3/4/18, 2:24:02 PM] Aum Jadhav: Just FYI, credit karma scores are just an estimate. There’s like a 30-35pt difference in my score on CK and my official FICO score
[3/4/18, 2:26:55 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Is the estimate higher or lower than the actual?
[3/4/18, 2:27:36 PM] Aum Jadhav: It was lower for me, so it’s not bad. But makes you doubt the scoring system :P
[3/4/18, 2:28:01 PM] Aum Jadhav: https://yelp.to/qTKq/PeyufmDs1K
[3/4/18, 2:28:24 PM] Maitreya Naik: Korean food at Nakwon Garden?

[3/4/18, 2:36:05 PM] Aum Jadhav: Another good one. More food options. We can probably finalize when we meet
[3/4/18, 2:36:36 PM] Maitreya Naik: Cool. Limited options. But we can look around if it's not enough
[3/4/18, 2:36:55 PM] Aum Jadhav: https://yelp.to/qTKq/KbFuWHat1K
^the one with more food options
[3/4/18, 2:37:24 PM] Maitreya Naik: Oh ya. This one I've been meaning to check out

[3/4/18, 2:37:45 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: I can check menus if you suggest some places
[3/4/18, 2:38:01 PM] Sid Dalmia CMU: hmm Apteka :P
[3/4/18, 2:41:07 PM] Maitreya Naik: Looks different. Works
[3/4/18, 2:43:56 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Apteka has nice food :)
[3/4/18, 2:49:00 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: It is nice :)
[3/4/18, 2:49:23 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: It's not a very loud place though :P
[3/4/18, 2:50:19 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: But there's no non-vegan food
[3/4/18, 3:34:25 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: I looked at the menus of all the places and there's not much that's super vegan friendly so we can just go wherever you guys like the best

I'm sure they'll be able to fix something up
[3/4/18, 3:54:23 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Wait.
[3/4/18, 3:54:29 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I just processed this.
[3/4/18, 3:54:46 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: You're vegan now?
[3/4/18, 3:54:49 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: What?
[3/4/18, 3:54:53 PM] Aum Jadhav: Apteka seems awesome
[3/4/18, 3:59:22 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Yes.

[3/4/18, 4:51:20 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: They're so drunk they got it backwards
[3/4/18, 4:51:52 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Also, people, find yourself someone who has a PS4 and just sit there and watch them play The Last Of Us.
[3/4/18, 4:52:15 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: (extra tidbit: the creative director of that game is an ETC alum)
[3/4/18, 4:53:01 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It's just so good I haven't been able to stop playing it.

[3/12/18, 4:55:38 PM] Shivam Gupta: FYI can't move the data over to the alumni email. So you lose all mail/drive data you have.

[3/12/18, 4:56:27 PM] Shivam Gupta: Nope

[3/12/18, 4:58:38 PM] Shivam Gupta: You'll have to do that manually. 
I suggestion would be to setup auto-reply (like vacation responder).

[3/16/18, 5:36:48 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Couple of questions to the experienced before I start Googling:
1. @14128166635 and @16464921633, does having earned from CMU make it any easier for us to file returns? Do we have some service of CMU's we can use?
2. Do I need to file tax returns from UW also? Basically I earned from two sources in 2017 so...I need a W2 form from both right?
[3/16/18, 5:48:15 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: 1. I think so - not super sure
2. Yes
[3/16/18, 5:48:56 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: 3. Why the fuck am I awake.
[3/16/18, 7:48:45 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Thanks! :)

[3/17/18, 10:58:10 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: People who've been TA's: did you get a 1098-T from CMU?
[3/17/18, 11:04:48 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: W2
[3/17/18, 11:06:44 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Just checked, you can get your 1098-T in SIO
[3/17/18, 11:07:14 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I guess the 1098-T is not just for TAs, it's everyone who paid tuition
[3/17/18, 11:14:21 AM] Shivam Gupta: Yep that's and Sio and you get w2 if you were paid through CMU workday (ra/ta)

[3/17/18, 11:27:48 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Really cool visualization!
[3/17/18, 11:27:51 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: What do the colors mean?
[3/17/18, 11:28:14 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Low to high frequency
[3/17/18, 11:28:18 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Bass to treble
[3/17/18, 11:28:24 PM] Prithvi Shankar: freq
[3/17/18, 11:29:17 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Also the particles - the more distinct they are, the dryer the sound. More blend = more reverb. (it's a reverb plugin - called Chroma. Ships with Logic now)
[3/17/18, 11:33:08 PM] Koushik Bhavani: It looks really nice
[3/17/18, 11:36:54 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Oooh! Didn't notice the particles the first time. Nice! :o
[3/17/18, 11:43:10 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Yuss it's really good to have that visualisation. It's helped me already lol.
[3/17/18, 11:51:13 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Here's a shittily mixed track to go with the visualization. See if you can tell which track I used the reverb on. Should be pretty obvious.
[3/17/18, 11:51:25 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: <‎audio omitted>

[3/19/18, 11:16:41 AM] Koushik Bhavani: Ya crazy news :o
[3/19/18, 11:33:06 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Any idea what they mean by "Uber suspended testing in Tempe, Pittsburgh blah blah"?
[3/19/18, 11:34:54 AM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: Self driving cars were suspended here
[3/19/18, 11:35:32 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: As in no longer allowed to test? Woah. That's sad.
[3/19/18, 11:35:59 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Critical systems are scary to program.
[3/19/18, 11:37:13 AM] Koushik Bhavani: Uber has recalled all testing vehicles yes
[3/19/18, 11:40:29 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: And this happened while a human driving was sitting there. I don't even know what he was doing
[3/19/18, 11:41:09 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I don't wanna be in his shoes right now.
[3/19/18, 11:41:13 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: And California has now allowed testing of self driving cars without a human driver
[3/19/18, 11:41:26 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Nice knowing you guys
[3/19/18, 11:42:15 AM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: Wait for the whole story before blaming anyone😅
[3/19/18, 11:42:42 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Is this for all companies?
[3/19/18, 11:43:00 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I would think it would be allowed case by case
[3/19/18, 11:43:00 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: You'd still need to get a permit, but yes

[3/20/18, 2:47:17 PM] Maitreya Naik: Ya. He's a VC too. Seems like he has a stealth start-up
[3/20/18, 5:08:41 PM] Michael RI: Hmm cool

[3/20/18, 9:01:18 PM] Shrivani CMU: Anyone would do. The other one is KTV. I don't think it has Bollywood. Kbox has very limited Bollywood but is more expensive in comparison. The other one is near Forbes and shady. Either one is fine with me. 😁
[3/20/18, 9:06:07 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: 🤩
[3/20/18, 9:18:46 PM] Michael RI: They did actually! There was no NDA but let me ask them what they're ok with me sharing before I spill the beans haha

[3/21/18, 11:38:38 AM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: Everywhere it says student ID is required, does that mean we can’t ask anyone to pick for us?
[3/21/18, 11:40:37 AM] Koushik Bhavani: Send a photo copy they should mostly agree I think
[3/21/18, 11:41:12 AM] Nupur Kulkarni CMU: Nvm, we can collect it during the commencement week

[3/22/18, 12:06:53 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: In ~Telugu
[3/22/18, 12:07:06 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Yeah, it's in Kannada and it's saying the same thing
[3/22/18, 12:07:27 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I've given up hope lol
[3/22/18, 12:08:55 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: ooh :D
[3/22/18, 12:10:43 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Well if you wanna go all Kannada Grammar Nazi, it's actually Nammade and not namde.
[3/22/18, 12:11:00 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: No, not even that
[3/22/18, 12:13:46 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: ನಮ್ಮದೇ *
[3/22/18, 12:14:03 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Damn, that took a while to find
[3/22/18, 4:58:56 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I just spent an afternoon talking to six aunties here. MOST satisfying 😋
[3/22/18, 5:00:41 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Koushik, you'd have loved it too. Such gossip. :P
[3/22/18, 5:28:56 AM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: I like how Aditi approved it😂

[3/22/18, 8:34:21 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Will do :D
[3/22/18, 8:34:35 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Anyone applying for H1B? Any thoughts on Premium Processing?
[3/22/18, 8:37:41 AM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: I read they stopped it this year
[3/22/18, 8:38:05 AM] Aum Jadhav: Is true
[3/22/18, 8:38:13 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Yup. They've stopped it till September
[3/22/18, 8:40:11 AM] Maitreya Naik: They have temporarily stopped premium processing since Monday ( I think) to September
[3/22/18, 8:40:42 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: They've labelled it as a temporary suspension. In case it actually is temporary, what are your thoughts on it? any benefit from it? And do we pay the money for it?
[3/22/18, 8:41:37 AM] Maitreya Naik: Usually the legal team filing your H1B pays for it for a big company. It depends on the company
[3/22/18, 8:41:50 AM] Maitreya Naik: *H1B caps only
[3/22/18, 8:41:52 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Ohh I see
[3/22/18, 8:42:12 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: What are H1B caps? need to learn this new lingo
[3/22/18, 8:43:40 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: And if your H1B gets premium processed, does it mean you can travel out of the US earlier?
[3/22/18, 8:43:41 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Like is there any benefit at all?
[3/22/18, 8:44:55 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: I think it's just faster processing. So it probably means you can travel out sooner.
[3/22/18, 8:45:01 AM] Shivam Gupta: It just gives you the decision sooner within (2 weeks ) rather than waiting till October 1st. 
You need to pay ~$1200
[3/22/18, 8:47:24 AM] Maitreya Naik: Yupp
[3/22/18, 8:47:51 AM] Maitreya Naik: https://www.uscis.gov/news/alerts/uscis-will-temporarily-suspend-premium-processing-fiscal-year-2019-h-1b-cap-petitions

Here's the announcement. You can subscribe to the mailing list to receive email notification of updates
[3/22/18, 8:51:53 AM] Maitreya Naik: We are applying for our H1B for the first time. So we get an entry in the H1B Cap lottery which caps the number of approved visas to 65000 for candidates with a US bachelor's degree equivalent of the specialty occupation that we are applying for.
And 20000 *more* for candidates with US Master's degree or higher.
[3/22/18, 8:51:58 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Too much grown up talk. You guys have grown up wow..
[3/22/18, 8:53:24 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: haha trying to :P
[3/22/18, 8:56:15 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: mmh Are you haven't enough? 🔥
[3/22/18, 8:56:28 AM] Maitreya Naik: But I recall CMU not being eligible for the 20000 extra cap
[3/22/18, 8:56:51 AM] Maitreya Naik: *And you
[3/22/18, 8:56:53 AM] Shivam Gupta: Why?
[3/22/18, 8:57:08 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: 😄
[3/22/18, 8:57:29 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: Growning old, for sure. Growing up..
[3/22/18, 8:59:39 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: 😂😂
[3/22/18, 9:00:41 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: Or*
[3/22/18, 9:03:13 AM] Maitreya Naik: Something about not being accredited by a nationalmy recognized accreditation authority when we were joining in August 2016. That may have changed now though
[3/22/18, 9:03:26 AM] Maitreya Naik: Can't find the FAQ since the OIE website layout changed
[3/22/18, 9:03:39 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: :O
[3/22/18, 9:08:33 AM] Shivam Gupta: Ok
[3/22/18, 9:32:29 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: 89.46% sure I heard this cap stuff mentioned in the oie opt seminar
[3/22/18, 9:33:07 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: 100% unsure about whether they said we're eligible / ineligible.
[3/22/18, 9:33:47 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: 0% chance of me liking today's weather (had to have a third statement with a percentage)
[3/22/18, 9:34:03 AM] Shruti Rijhwani: 😂
[3/22/18, 9:34:07 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: ;)
[3/22/18, 12:23:20 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: The Uber accident video, seems like it might have been difficult to spot the pedestrian even for a human driver. But then again, the video might not be how we'd have seen it... 🤔
[3/22/18, 12:43:43 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: As Sanjay pointed out somewhere. That's a tough question because our eyes can many times be better than cameras but... we don't have Lidars 😅
[3/22/18, 12:44:40 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Yeah, surprising that the lidar missed 😶
[3/22/18, 12:49:31 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: ,
[3/22/18, 3:50:12 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: *dramatic pause*
[3/22/18, 3:54:14 PM] Prithvi Shankar: thing is, there was no indication of stopping in the video. It was very bad lighting, agreed but I think human drivers would've braked at some point which might have minimized the damage
[3/22/18, 4:38:48 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Have to revise this. It's sunny again :D
[3/22/18, 7:55:34 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I'm at Dosa Allee again LOL

[3/26/18, 12:56:04 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Why not buy it on campus during the weekend?
[3/26/18, 12:57:52 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: What if they all get sold out? Or what if they don't have my size? :/
[3/26/18, 1:04:45 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: If you want to avoid shipping cost I'm happy to buy for you
[3/26/18, 1:05:47 PM] Aum Jadhav: Same. But I think they ask for IDs or something too. Just confirm
[3/26/18, 1:05:57 PM] Sid Dalmia CMU: Yes they allow this.
[3/26/18, 1:06:11 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: I bought for Deepak last time so I think it's ok.
[3/26/18, 1:07:09 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Not sure how they'll react if I buy like 10 sets though 😂
[3/26/18, 1:07:12 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: This happens?
[3/26/18, 1:07:44 PM] Aum Jadhav: Maybe y'all can order online and we can pick up from the university store?
[3/26/18, 1:08:10 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I'll ask a friend to get mine for me then, I guess
[3/26/18, 1:09:26 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: I dunno but I don't want to be stuck wearing something that doesn't fit :/
[3/26/18, 1:09:45 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: I don't know if we can do this. Maybe we can call the bookstore and ask
[3/26/18, 1:09:52 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Fair
[3/26/18, 1:11:30 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Can you do this and let me know?
[3/26/18, 1:14:54 PM] Deepak Gopinath CMU: Thank you! :)
[3/26/18, 1:15:10 PM] Maitreya Naik: Let us know if that works
[3/26/18, 1:20:41 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Sure I can do this :)
[3/26/18, 1:24:49 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: So I just called the Bookstore, and they're like "Even if you came in and ordered it here, they'd still charge you the shipping cost to ship it to us".
[3/26/18, 1:25:03 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: So apparently there's no escaping the shipping cost
[3/26/18, 1:25:51 PM] Aum Jadhav: Man CMU is such a money sink
[3/26/18, 1:26:32 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: I know 😞
[3/26/18, 1:28:24 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Oh you mean if you order it online?


But if I go there and buy?
[3/26/18, 1:28:55 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: In grad fair it was $82
[3/26/18, 1:29:39 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: So even if you went in to the store and bought it from them, they'd have to place the order with the gown makers and they'd charge shipping to have it sent to CMU too
[3/26/18, 1:29:45 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: If that's what I was told
[3/26/18, 1:30:11 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: *or that's what...
[3/26/18, 1:36:40 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Oh wow
[3/26/18, 1:36:49 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: So even buying it on campus is the same cost now?
[3/26/18, 1:37:10 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: That's why they had the stupid grad fair
[3/26/18, 1:37:11 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Ugh
[3/26/18, 1:37:27 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I can't wait to be so rich that this doesn't faze me.
[3/26/18, 1:38:00 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I doubt I'll ever be that rich though. :P
[3/26/18, 5:09:05 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Btw, I bought mine from Swarna
[3/26/18, 5:09:09 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Some of you met her
[3/26/18, 5:09:27 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: She graduated in May, before me, so I just bought from her at half price
[3/26/18, 5:09:39 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Any of you have conveniently located seniors?
[3/26/18, 5:09:54 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Yes. I bought mine from Deepak. 😝
[3/26/18, 5:10:07 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: The only thing you would have to get different is the tassel
[3/26/18, 5:10:24 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: If you wanted to :P
[3/26/18, 5:10:43 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Because the tassel has the year on it
[3/26/18, 5:15:31 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I have conveniently located seniors, but they are not conveniently sized.
[3/26/18, 5:16:06 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Knew I should refrain from all that ice cream.
[3/26/18, 5:16:10 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Ahh. True, that's a consideration also
[3/26/18, 5:27:12 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: https://sunil-nayak.com/

Getting my ETC group to tell me all my mistakes in here as well, so if you guys find any, it'll be much appreciated. 

I'll make a personalized 30 second jingle for you which you can use as a ringtone if you find any mistake (and you're the first to find it)
:)
[3/26/18, 5:27:20 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: (sorry, off topic)
[3/26/18, 5:28:42 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Which you'll have within Sunday, this week *
[3/26/18, 5:44:35 PM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: We don't have to return it?
[3/26/18, 6:01:10 PM] Prithvi Shankar: Nah. It's yours. Potential harry potter Halloween costume
[3/26/18, 6:08:08 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Do you still have yours :)
[3/26/18, 6:08:10 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: ?
[3/26/18, 6:08:44 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: (no I haven't worked the logistics out)
[3/26/18, 6:08:47 PM] Prithvi Shankar: I'm also graduating now da 🤣
[3/26/18, 6:08:58 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Oh lol I thought you graduated in December
[3/26/18, 6:09:00 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: My bad
[3/26/18, 6:09:11 PM] Prithvi Shankar: Yes. But grad walk is in May
[3/26/18, 6:09:37 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Oh so December people are coming back in May?
[3/26/18, 6:09:38 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I see
[3/26/18, 6:11:10 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: You can if you want, but not necessary
[3/26/18, 6:12:23 PM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: Any idea how much money we get back if we return it?
[3/26/18, 6:13:12 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: That's the weird thing I don't think we do
[3/26/18, 6:13:32 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: So why would anyon
[3/26/18, 6:13:58 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Suddenly I imagined a superhero comic type situation, where the costume is put up on a pedestal, except it's a grad student and robes. 
Powers of sleeplessness / anxiety.
[3/26/18, 8:43:04 PM] Aum Jadhav: You don't return it for a cashback. You can "recycle" it for free
[3/26/18, 8:43:18 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Great deal right?
[3/26/18, 8:43:23 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Might as well sell it to people
[3/26/18, 8:44:12 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: What color hood do you people have btw?
[3/26/18, 8:49:57 PM] Aum Jadhav: Yellow
[3/26/18, 8:50:27 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Ah okay
[3/26/18, 8:50:39 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: So I can't sell mine to your juniors :P
[3/26/18, 8:50:47 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Not that I know any, come to think of it
[3/26/18, 8:51:02 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: ECE peeps? Red hood?
[3/26/18, 8:56:05 PM] Aum Jadhav: 🙈 sneaky
[3/26/18, 9:08:04 PM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: Haha, right
[3/26/18, 9:16:37 PM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: Green
[3/26/18, 9:17:04 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: 😒
[3/26/18, 9:17:20 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: We'll be so colourful though :D
[3/26/18, 9:22:02 PM] Maitreya Naik: No seriously. CMU had posters saying how we can recycle the gowns
[3/26/18, 9:22:25 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Yeah and I asked a rep. he also said the same thing
[3/26/18, 9:22:27 PM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: I know. Read about it
[3/26/18, 9:22:58 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: That would never fly in India

[3/27/18, 9:26:59 AM] Shreyas Shenoy: Did you guys get any letter from CMU to invite relatives for the commencement?
[3/27/18, 9:27:46 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: Like an invitation letter?
[3/27/18, 9:27:51 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: Not really
[3/27/18, 9:27:56 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: You can write the letter yourself
[3/27/18, 9:28:01 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Inviting your relatives
[3/27/18, 9:28:07 AM] Prithvi Shankar: I think you can find it on the website
[3/27/18, 9:28:09 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: That’s what CMU says on their website
[3/27/18, 9:28:18 AM] Shreyas Shenoy: Oh okay
[3/27/18, 9:28:28 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: CMU says you don't need a letter of invitation for visa purposes also 😂
[3/27/18, 9:28:30 AM] Prithvi Shankar: This probably has everything you’d need: https://www.cmu.edu/oie/families/invite_rel.pdf
[3/27/18, 9:28:58 AM] Shreyas Shenoy: My dad was saying that they’re asking for it at the consulate
[3/27/18, 9:29:11 AM] Shreyas Shenoy: Cool thanks 👍
[3/27/18, 9:29:19 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Check if this helps
[3/27/18, 9:35:21 AM] Shreyas Shenoy: So just like type it out, scan, sign and send right?
[3/27/18, 9:37:47 AM] Shivam Gupta: Yep
[3/27/18, 9:37:59 AM] Shivam Gupta: They didn't ask my parents for any documents though
[3/27/18, 9:41:34 AM] Shreyas Shenoy: All right cool

[3/31/18, 2:07:08 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Just today lol that was like my 5th air dribble
[3/31/18, 2:07:46 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I can relatively consistently start off the air dribble now, but following through is still tough. And this is just in the training. Haven't done it in a real match :p
[3/31/18, 2:08:11 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: <‎video omitted>
[3/31/18, 2:08:12 PM] Koushik Bhavani: Finally reaching my level :p

[3/31/18, 2:09:43 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I am sure 2v2 Koushik and I can beat you plus anyone else
[3/31/18, 2:09:49 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: But 1v1 you'll probably beat me
[3/31/18, 2:10:32 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Koushiks good with stupid ass defence so hard to say
[3/31/18, 2:11:02 PM] Koushik Bhavani: When did you start appreciating others :o
[3/31/18, 2:11:12 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Just you 😛
[3/31/18, 2:11:27 PM] Koushik Bhavani: ;)
[3/31/18, 2:13:51 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I think they made it cross platform recently
[3/31/18, 2:13:54 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Not sure through
[3/31/18, 2:13:56 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Though *
[3/31/18, 2:14:07 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Only one way to find out :)

[4/1/18, 3:41:37 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: (spoilers)
[4/1/18, 3:42:02 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: If any of you played it, prepare to have your mind blown. If you haven't, and are interested, watch a playthrough.
[4/1/18, 3:42:36 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: @14128166635 this is way creepier than /r/nosleep btw
[4/1/18, 3:43:53 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: As someone who's in this industry, looking at such intricately designed work just makes me want to sit down and take a breath while trying to keep my jaw from dropping to the floor.
[4/1/18, 3:52:23 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Also, there's this. Completely unrelated, still cool:
https://www.boredpanda.com/aluminum-foil-ball-japan/
[4/1/18, 7:19:46 PM] Maitreya Naik: This came too late 😂
[4/1/18, 7:20:32 PM] Maitreya Naik: Watched the whole game being played on 2x. The first run sets things up really well for the latter runs
[4/2/18, 6:51:46 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Holy shit I just saw someone who was literally the spitting image of Edna from the Incredibles.
[4/2/18, 6:52:21 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: You should've played it.
[4/2/18, 9:11:31 PM] Maitreya Naik: Watched it after I was done grading papers XD
[4/2/18, 9:11:36 PM] Maitreya Naik: Wanted something passive
[4/2/18, 9:11:36 PM] Maitreya Naik: But instead I got engrossed
[4/2/18, 9:12:26 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Gg lol
[4/2/18, 10:26:53 PM] Prithvi Shankar: Anyone on this group in a t-mobile one plan?

[4/2/18, 10:27:43 PM] Prithvi Shankar: T mobile one? How much are you folks paying?
[4/2/18, 10:28:08 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: With 6 of us, about $33 a month
[4/2/18, 10:28:17 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: With 5, about $37
[4/2/18, 10:28:39 PM] Prithvi Shankar: This is the unlimited data option right? And someone gave their SSN to t-mobile?
[4/2/18, 10:28:48 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Yeah
[4/2/18, 10:54:05 PM] Aum Jadhav: @14128198111 looking for a family?
[4/2/18, 10:55:19 PM] Prithvi Shankar: I need to add myself and probably 3 other ppl
[4/2/18, 10:55:53 PM] Aum Jadhav: We’re 4 already, can it be 7? :P
[4/2/18, 10:56:12 PM] Prithvi Shankar: With t-mobile one there can be 12 ppl 😅
[4/3/18, 8:02:56 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I'm leaving my group so there is at least my space with Sanjay, Koushik and Gautam
[4/3/18, 8:09:15 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Yeah. Joining them mostly
[4/3/18, 8:33:53 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: 😢
[4/3/18, 8:39:41 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: Can I join?
[4/3/18, 8:42:47 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Yes. That will be $100, thanks! ☺
[4/3/18, 8:42:51 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: Lol
[4/3/18, 8:43:22 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: As long as it costs less than $45 after taxes and I can keep my number, I'm in
[4/3/18, 8:43:41 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Oh, you were serious :P
[4/3/18, 8:44:17 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: As long as Aditi doesn’t change her mind and come back, and Prithvi brings less than 3 friends, we have room

[4/3/18, 2:10:53 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Is anyone we know there?
[4/3/18, 2:11:04 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: / have we heard from them?
[4/3/18, 2:15:54 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: The United States Department of Homeland Security defines the active shooter as "an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a confined and populated area; in most cases, active shooters use firearms(s) [sic] and there is no pattern or method to their selection of victims.
[4/3/18, 2:15:57 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: TIL
[4/3/18, 2:22:37 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: One of my coworkers just left because his wife works in that building
[4/3/18, 2:22:43 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: He said she got out fine
[4/3/18, 2:22:49 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Oh thank god
[4/3/18, 2:23:31 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I remember being there last Jan and thinking 'this would be an amazing place to work at'
[4/3/18, 2:23:50 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: *shudder*
[4/3/18, 2:29:43 PM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: WTF
[4/3/18, 8:50:26 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Rocket league tournament update is out. This means we can cross platform.
[4/4/18, 9:33:54 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: @17246477160 someone keeps trying to get into my FB. 
I've received a lot of password reset emails / texts. 

I've enabled 2FA and changed my passwords across the board. Anything else I can do?
[4/4/18, 9:34:11 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I also turned off password reset for my account
[4/4/18, 10:09:13 AM] Shivam Gupta: Yeah I get the password reset emails too. Don't know what's up with it
[4/4/18, 10:10:00 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I'm actually afraid I might have been phished
[4/4/18, 10:10:06 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: But I didn't give any information out
[4/4/18, 10:10:14 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It prompted me to login but I didn't.
[4/4/18, 10:10:32 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: No idea what's going on
[4/4/18, 10:53:29 AM] Deepak Gopinath CMU: Log out of all devices and change password?
[4/4/18, 11:00:42 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Did that already
[4/4/18, 11:00:55 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I'll do it again tonight

[4/6/18, 9:14:29 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Some departments asked for a "confirmation fee"
[4/6/18, 9:14:32 PM] Koushik Bhavani: Yes advance we had to

[4/6/18, 9:35:12 PM] Koushik Bhavani: And Avk

[4/6/18, 9:35:56 PM] Shivam Gupta: Yes I agree
[4/6/18, 9:36:25 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Oops

[4/7/18, 11:14:10 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Do any of you recognize the song?
[4/7/18, 11:19:28 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: Isn't it any song by a 20-year old with a voice tuner?
[4/7/18, 11:19:40 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Hahahaha
[4/7/18, 11:19:45 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Savage

[4/8/18, 2:09:43 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Anyone who's filed for state tax returns and free for a sec?
[4/8/18, 2:10:23 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: you finally ate fish? o.o

[4/8/18, 2:42:04 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Got it cleared, thanks :)
[4/8/18, 2:59:00 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Did anyone else get that they dont need to file state taxes when using Sprintax?
[4/8/18, 2:59:01 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: o.O
[4/8/18, 3:00:16 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I used TurboTax and then after paying $60 realized that I was about to file the wrong 1040
[4/8/18, 3:00:33 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: But I paid the $60 for the state stuff
[4/8/18, 3:04:36 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Oh yeah apparently that's for residents
[4/10/18, 10:30:42 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Did you listen to the whole thing? Was it still that generic? :P
[4/10/18, 10:31:06 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: (I ask coz I'm particularly proud of this cover haha)
[4/10/18, 10:31:41 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: Haven't yet.
[4/10/18, 10:31:46 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: I'll tell when I do 🙃
[4/10/18, 10:34:02 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: 👍🏻
[4/10/18, 10:57:28 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Also, guys, do you know anyone in LA who's subletting from May-Aug by any chance?
[4/10/18, 4:49:24 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Is Glacier only for Federal?
[4/10/18, 4:49:36 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: What can I use for State and Local?
[4/10/18, 4:49:37 PM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: Yes
[4/10/18, 4:49:43 PM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: Sprintax
[4/10/18, 4:49:53 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Ahh okay
[4/10/18, 4:50:15 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: And I have just about started tax work. About how long should it take me?
[4/10/18, 4:50:34 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: An hour
[4/10/18, 4:50:36 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Or two
[4/10/18, 4:50:45 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: that
[4/10/18, 4:50:46 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: *That's it? :O
[4/10/18, 4:50:53 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I work slowly on forms
[4/10/18, 4:51:42 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Yeah. But Sprintax said on its site "some form preparations are handled personally by our staff and may take time"
[4/10/18, 4:51:54 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Ohh okay thank you!
[4/10/18, 4:52:00 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: This is good to know :D
[4/10/18, 4:52:21 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Also make sure you do ONLY state via Sprintax. Otherwise they do both federal and state for you and charge more
[4/10/18, 4:52:28 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: If I am not wrong*
[4/10/18, 4:52:38 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Sure :)
[4/10/18, 4:55:06 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Ohh I see. I can do local with them also right?
[4/10/18, 4:56:53 PM] Maitreya Naik: They don't do local :(
[4/10/18, 4:57:29 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Local?! Isn't it just federal and state
[4/10/18, 4:57:32 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: FML
[4/10/18, 4:57:33 PM] Maitreya Naik: But it's just one short form. I'm yet to do local but you need your state form filled before you can mail your local
[4/10/18, 4:57:39 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: How are you people doing local?
[4/10/18, 4:57:50 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Oh just fill it yourself?
[4/10/18, 4:57:55 PM] Maitreya Naik: Probably just filling it out. May look at Glacier
[4/10/18, 4:57:57 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I feel you
[4/10/18, 4:58:04 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Noooo. Not more forms 😭
[4/10/18, 4:59:44 PM] Maitreya Naik: http://www.jordantax.com/Forms/JTS-2017TaxpayerAnnualLocalEITReturnACCTCD.pdf
[4/10/18, 4:59:47 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Nothing like local my friends say 🤔
[4/10/18, 4:59:56 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Doesn't it come under state?
[4/10/18, 5:00:04 PM] Maitreya Naik: For Pittsburgh
[4/10/18, 5:00:05 PM] Koushik Bhavani: That’s what I thought lol
[4/10/18, 5:00:25 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: On Sprintax I mentioned that I paid some 25$ for local tax
[4/10/18, 5:00:32 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: So I think it should've been considered
[4/10/18, 5:00:43 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Haha did you pay that?
[4/10/18, 5:01:20 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Yeah Shruti paid 50 it seems. Seemed arbitrary in how much was being charged ☹️😶
[4/10/18, 5:01:46 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Should be mentioned in box 14 of w-2 as "LST" if you paid local tax
[4/10/18, 5:06:02 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Wtf is local now
[4/10/18, 5:06:15 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I paid 60 for TurboTax shit
[4/10/18, 5:06:22 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Wow isn't this fun
[4/10/18, 5:06:27 PM] Maitreya Naik: Nope
[4/10/18, 5:06:46 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I was done with taxes.
[4/10/18, 5:06:49 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: This is bullshit.
[4/10/18, 5:06:52 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: What local
[4/10/18, 5:07:07 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I HATE being 23.
[4/10/18, 5:07:08 PM] Maitreya Naik: Lol
[4/10/18, 5:07:11 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Thanks life.
[4/10/18, 5:07:39 PM] Maitreya Naik: Be 75 and get phished by random phone calls from "IRS" :P
[4/10/18, 5:08:36 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: That's happening to lots of us right now
[4/10/18, 5:08:36 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: So
[4/10/18, 5:12:19 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Can I at least do that city stuff online?
[4/10/18, 5:56:39 PM] Maitreya Naik: You too? Shame
[4/10/18, 5:57:04 PM] Maitreya Naik: Depends on the city you earned and got taxed in.
[4/10/18, 5:57:17 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: McLean, Pittsburgh
[4/10/18, 5:57:22 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: VA, PA
[4/10/18, 5:57:52 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: (and now I'm in CA, soon, in LA)
[4/10/18, 5:58:04 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Though LA isn't a state
[4/10/18, 5:58:07 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Pity
[4/10/18, 5:58:26 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Not me, but a lot of my friends and some of my profs also lol
[4/10/18, 6:40:36 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: So if there's no Local Income Tax listed on your W2 you don't need to file local taxes correct?
[4/10/18, 6:55:54 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/finance/2017_LST_REFUND_FORM.pdf
[4/10/18, 6:55:59 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Looks like that's the one.
[4/10/18, 6:56:06 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Just one page. Just fill it and send.
[4/10/18, 6:56:11 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: 👍
[4/10/18, 6:56:39 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: You sure?
[4/10/18, 6:56:47 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: The thing listed on CMU's site is different
[4/10/18, 6:59:11 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: That's Local Services
[4/10/18, 6:59:45 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I have Earned Income so I have to do this: http://www.jordantax.com/Forms/JTS-2017TaxpayerAnnualLocalEITReturnACCTCD.pdf

What Mai said, basically. It's listed on CMU's site
[4/10/18, 6:59:58 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: https://www.cmu.edu/oie/news-and-events/2017-2018/march/tax-student.html
[4/10/18, 7:01:48 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Okay yeah what I pointed to is some bullshit :P
[4/10/18, 7:02:03 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: What you pointed to is rught and it's so many fucking pages
[4/10/18, 7:16:10 PM] Maitreya Naik: 😂
[4/10/18, 7:16:25 PM] Maitreya Naik: Only 1 is important I think. Others are instructions
[4/10/18, 7:17:31 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Thanks for the local tax info :)
[4/10/18, 7:26:58 PM] Maitreya Naik: 👍🏼
Also, they ask for an account number and pin. But we don't need those if we are mailing the forms. Those 2 details are for online filing and are sent to people in the mail
[4/10/18, 7:27:21 PM] Maitreya Naik: The mails were sent out during January or February and we are probably not going to receive them
[4/10/18, 7:27:35 PM] Maitreya Naik: So just leave account and pin blank. This is for Pittsburgh
[4/10/18, 7:36:14 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: 👍🏻👍🏻
[4/10/18, 7:38:33 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: So what do I do if my refund amount is 0? :P
[4/10/18, 7:38:37 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Should I still send it in?
[4/10/18, 7:48:33 PM] Maitreya Naik: Lol. Ya
[4/10/18, 7:48:56 PM] Maitreya Naik: They need to know that you don't owe them :P
[4/10/18, 7:55:04 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Done filing
[4/10/18, 7:55:07 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Fuck yeah
[4/10/18, 7:55:13 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Take that adulthood
[4/10/18, 10:33:55 PM] Maitreya Naik: https://www.cmu.edu/oie/news-and-events/2017-2018/march/tax-student.html

Here's for us slower adults
[4/10/18, 10:34:42 PM] Maitreya Naik: Says to include visa documents with the local tax return. So I assume I20, Visa, I94, and passport
[4/10/18, 10:34:48 PM] Maitreya Naik: Copies of course
[4/10/18, 10:40:44 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Uh oh
[4/10/18, 10:40:55 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I just sent visa and passport stuff lol
[4/10/18, 10:40:58 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Whoops
[4/10/18, 10:41:20 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Spoke too soon.
[4/10/18, 10:48:11 PM] Maitreya Naik: I20 would probably be necessary. It was for DL and State ID. Stop that mail can!
[4/10/18, 10:48:15 PM] Maitreya Naik: *mail van
[4/10/18, 10:50:21 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Too late lol
[4/10/18, 10:50:30 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Well I'm screwed
[4/10/18, 10:50:53 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I honestly dont know what to do.
[4/10/18, 10:51:04 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I'm going to sleep.
[4/11/18, 4:57:38 AM] Maitreya Naik: You can just call the Tax Service office. For Pittsburgh, it's Jordan Tax Services
[4/11/18, 4:58:06 AM] Maitreya Naik: 11pm? Very early
[4/11/18, 5:32:38 AM] Shruti Rijhwani: Last year I did not send anything with local tax form, because it was all zeros. Just the w2
[4/11/18, 5:53:56 AM] Maitreya Naik: Oh. CMU has some payments that are only taxable federally. But our non-CMU employer would have taxed state or locally. For example, I might end up getting a refund owing to 1% local tax for non-residents
[4/11/18, 5:54:31 AM] Shruti Rijhwani: Right quite likely. I've only been paid by CMU so my local tax box on W2 is blank
[4/11/18, 5:57:02 AM] Shruti Rijhwani: If you see the reasons on this page, I am not eligible to get my $52 back. 😂
[4/11/18, 6:01:08 AM] Maitreya Naik: Ya XD
[4/11/18, 6:18:04 AM] Shruti Rijhwani: v sad. i will miss my $52
[4/11/18, 8:36:08 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Oh yeah? Yay!
[4/11/18, 8:48:57 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: If I am not making music, I rarely have any other reason to stay up.
[4/11/18, 10:31:32 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: <‎image omitted>
[4/11/18, 11:59:37 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Free sushi at work for programmers today :')
[4/11/18, 1:51:11 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I got some form from Aetna. 1095 B
[4/11/18, 1:51:30 PM] Sid Dalmia CMU: I think that can be ignored
[4/11/18, 1:51:35 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Ahh okay
[4/11/18, 1:52:52 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: And the Employer ID Number, is that the same as the Employer's Fed ID Number?
[4/11/18, 2:02:27 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: And what did you put as the phone number of the Designated School Official (from your I 20)
[4/11/18, 2:04:04 PM] Sid Dalmia CMU: 412-268-5231
[4/11/18, 2:05:13 PM] Sid Dalmia CMU: I think this is the field H in W2 ? I am not sure
[4/11/18, 2:07:44 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Thanks!
[4/11/18, 2:08:56 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: And our PNC accounts are checking right?
[4/11/18, 2:09:35 PM] Sid Dalmia CMU: yes
[4/11/18, 2:17:30 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It sucked :(
[4/11/18, 6:15:55 PM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: What happens if you don't file city tax?
[4/11/18, 6:17:45 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Is that different from local?
[4/11/18, 6:18:15 PM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: Same thing
[4/11/18, 6:18:49 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: 😅
[4/11/18, 6:23:51 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Not filing is considered tax fraud it seems.
[4/11/18, 6:24:00 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I googled it
[4/11/18, 6:24:21 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I may be wrong, but why risk it
[4/11/18, 6:28:22 PM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: It's such a pain🤬
[4/11/18, 6:34:14 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: it's very unfortunate for you Poojito
[4/11/18, 6:34:33 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: very few states and cities have this and you HAD to go to Ohio :P
[4/11/18, 6:39:28 PM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: That makes me feel better 😊
[4/11/18, 6:47:36 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Ik :/ I'm sorry
[4/11/18, 6:51:39 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I am glad :) :P
[4/11/18, 8:44:49 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: How do you figure out if your states and cities have it?
[4/11/18, 8:47:53 PM] Shrivani CMU: <‎image omitted>
[4/11/18, 8:57:52 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I googled
[4/11/18, 9:35:23 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: 😂
[4/11/18, 9:35:50 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Thanks. Tomorrow is the fun day to deal with state and local tax
[4/11/18, 9:39:33 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Golly
[4/11/18, 9:43:54 PM] Maitreya Naik: Yupp
[4/12/18, 12:24:06 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: When they say 17th is tax day, what do we have to have done by then? Our documents should reach them?
[4/12/18, 12:26:09 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: I love that kind of questions. It's like "professor, you said 1000   words, does that include the title of the essay?"
[4/12/18, 12:26:31 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Yes
[4/12/18, 12:26:36 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: You like to live dangerously, don't you @14129614621?
[4/12/18, 12:26:53 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: The post doc in my lab told me the stamp has to be 17th
[4/12/18, 12:27:03 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: It can reach them later
[4/12/18, 12:27:26 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Apparently not
[4/12/18, 12:27:42 PM] Koushik Bhavani: Yess that’s what I have heard too
[4/12/18, 12:27:55 PM] Michael RI: hahaha
[4/12/18, 12:28:39 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: You should've heard her stories about her assignment submissions.
[4/12/18, 12:30:51 PM] Maitreya Naik: Lol
[4/12/18, 12:31:27 PM] Maitreya Naik: I thought they should reach by 17th. I think it's the safer assumption to have in any case. Priority express mail!
[4/12/18, 1:26:36 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Haha it's definitely safer and @14129615683 I don't like it but it ends up happening :P
[4/12/18, 1:26:54 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: 😬
[4/12/18, 1:27:35 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I just wanted to make sure I didn't leave it too late. I was trying to back calculate when to mail it. Realised it's today or tomorrow!
[4/12/18, 1:40:35 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: 17th is Tuesday right?
[4/12/18, 1:40:49 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: 1-day shopping on Monday 👌🏽
[4/12/18, 1:41:28 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Or, if you think you’re badass, same-day shipping on Tuesday 😎
[4/12/18, 1:42:32 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Is there same day shipping? I think there's only overnight shipping :P
[4/12/18, 1:43:00 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Same day shipping would be catching a flight to Texas and dropping it off :P
[4/12/18, 1:43:22 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Yeah, and then getting some bbq to celebrate 😁
[4/12/18, 2:09:18 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: You guys are way more last minute than me
[4/12/18, 2:11:49 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Guys. Saturday is ALMOST HERE
[4/12/18, 2:11:56 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: oh oops wrong group
[4/12/18, 2:12:12 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: 😂
[4/12/18, 2:12:27 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: But thank you for the excitement
[4/12/18, 2:12:59 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I haven't ever looked forward to a Saturday as much as this one.
[4/12/18, 2:13:08 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Shruti, you know what weekends are? 😛
[4/12/18, 2:13:44 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: nap time
[4/12/18, 2:16:43 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Isnt that everyday?
[4/12/18, 2:16:52 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: not when you're a cmu student
[4/12/18, 2:17:00 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I mean
[4/12/18, 2:17:05 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I was sleeping the whole time
[4/12/18, 2:17:13 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: My eyes may have been open, that's a different story
[4/12/18, 3:28:10 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: On State tax it asks if I've filed federal taxes. I've filled out the form. Does that count?
[4/12/18, 3:28:21 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Or do they mean have I sent it in?
[4/12/18, 3:28:31 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: they wont check it immediately :P
[4/12/18, 3:28:48 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Ohh haha okay so yes should work right?
[4/12/18, 3:28:52 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Forms keep confusing me
[4/12/18, 3:29:01 PM] Koushik Bhavani: Yess it is
[4/12/18, 3:29:29 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Thanks :D
[4/12/18, 3:29:32 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: You people are the best
[4/12/18, 3:35:33 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I know, thanks. :P
[4/12/18, 3:36:45 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: But you didn't answer right now 🤔
[4/12/18, 3:36:51 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I know right? This tax bullshit sucks. And I have a very high motivation towards destroying Sprintax so someday we will work and make everybody's lives easier for sure..
[4/12/18, 3:37:33 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: But okay since you feel this way, you can be included :D
[4/12/18, 3:37:43 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Woo! 😁
[4/13/18, 8:55:41 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Hey guys, is there a way to waive the young renter's fees at Enterprise?
[4/13/18, 8:56:40 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Become 25 years old 🙂
[4/13/18, 8:56:46 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: UW has a contract that lets me. Maybe check if your company has a contract?
[4/13/18, 8:57:06 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Does CMU have one?
[4/13/18, 8:57:10 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Yup
[4/13/18, 8:57:12 AM] Prithvi Shankar: XZ40041
[4/13/18, 8:57:16 AM] Prithvi Shankar: That's the code
[4/13/18, 8:57:33 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Okay, thanks a lot! :)
[4/13/18, 8:58:40 AM] Koushik Bhavani: Yess use that
[4/13/18, 12:08:07 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: For state tax, should I stay my residence in Connecticut for internship was temporary or permanent?
[4/13/18, 12:11:55 PM] Maitreya Naik: That is a good question 😅
[4/13/18, 12:13:22 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: ‎You deleted this message.
[4/13/18, 12:18:04 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Just a heads up:
If you've been in the US for over 5 years, you're supposed to also pay Medicare and social security it seems. Now all we have to do is remember this when we go past 5 years.
[4/13/18, 12:18:26 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: (even though you're not gonna get any of those benefits) (yay)
[4/13/18, 12:19:02 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I think also if you convert to H1B
[4/13/18, 12:19:06 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Yes.
[4/13/18, 12:19:13 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Though not sure about this
[4/13/18, 12:19:37 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: You're right. If you convert to H1B you're immediately liable for those.
[4/13/18, 12:32:11 PM] Maitreya Naik: Yes
[4/13/18, 12:40:20 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Sprintax says it takes upto 5 days. Does it actually?
[4/13/18, 12:44:17 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: We have to just send W-2s along with the tax forms right?
[4/13/18, 12:44:46 PM] Prithvi Shankar: Yup
[4/13/18, 12:44:46 PM] Koushik Bhavani: Depends
[4/13/18, 12:44:56 PM] Prithvi Shankar: 1-5 days
[4/13/18, 12:44:59 PM] Koushik Bhavani: I don’t know on what it depends but I still haven’t gotten it
[4/13/18, 12:45:03 PM] Koushik Bhavani: After 10 days
[4/13/18, 12:45:02 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Cool, thanks!
[4/13/18, 12:46:48 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Don't we also have to fill and send 8843?
[4/13/18, 12:50:53 PM] Koushik Bhavani: Did you use glacier ?
[4/13/18, 12:51:16 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Yes
[4/13/18, 12:51:20 PM] Koushik Bhavani: You should have gotten that as well along with 1040nr-ez
[4/13/18, 12:51:27 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Yaaaaa
[4/13/18, 1:09:40 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I didn't earn income in Pennsylvannia, so do I still fill out that form for local tax?
[4/13/18, 1:10:04 PM] Maitreya Naik: Been 7 for me without counting weekends. They said they will do it ASAP
[4/13/18, 1:10:36 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: The address for state tax forms is department of revenue Harrisburg blah blah right?
[4/13/18, 1:12:03 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: what happens if we are  late?
[4/13/18, 1:12:08 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Should I find a different service?
[4/13/18, 1:12:36 PM] Maitreya Naik: If we don't owe anything, nothing. If we do, then an interest is charged for every month that we don't file
[4/13/18, 1:12:43 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Oh okay
[4/13/18, 1:12:47 PM] Maitreya Naik: That's as far as I could tell
[4/13/18, 1:13:03 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Sounds decent
[4/13/18, 1:13:24 PM] Maitreya Naik: Ya. They won't pay us extra if they owe us a refund
[4/13/18, 1:13:28 PM] Maitreya Naik: Very vad
[4/13/18, 1:13:31 PM] Maitreya Naik: *bad
[4/13/18, 1:13:33 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Very
[4/13/18, 1:13:57 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Okay but local tax, do I print out that long jordan Tax document and fill it?
[4/13/18, 1:14:01 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It's been a few days and I haven't got my refund back yet
[4/13/18, 1:14:09 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Yes just page one though
[4/13/18, 1:14:20 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: If you didn't stay / earn anywhere else in PA
[4/13/18, 1:14:48 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Bro bro
[4/13/18, 1:14:53 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Is that the address??
[4/13/18, 1:15:00 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I gotta say, it's reassuring to have you guys around - makes adulting slightly easier
[4/13/18, 1:15:10 PM] Maitreya Naik: Yes. Only page 1. Other pages are instructions. 
Use. Blue/blank ink, and round everything up or down to the nearest dollar
[4/13/18, 1:15:11 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Wait
[4/13/18, 1:15:33 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Very
[4/13/18, 1:16:06 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Time to remember the rounding rules from school. 5 following even number/odd number...
[4/13/18, 1:16:11 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: @14129616423
[4/13/18, 1:16:24 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: (pic uploading)
[4/13/18, 1:17:04 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: <‎image omitted>
[4/13/18, 1:17:16 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It's been almost a month since I sent my stuff over
[4/13/18, 1:17:39 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: But I guess I used the slower delivery option
[4/13/18, 1:17:43 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: So it's fine maybe
[4/13/18, 1:18:07 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I just hope they don't mail my checks here when I'm in Santa Monica lol. That'll be annoying.
[4/13/18, 1:19:11 PM] Maitreya Naik: Ah. You requested cheques? Nice. Don't let them know your account details.
[4/13/18, 1:19:27 PM] Maitreya Naik: They can pull shit out, put shit in. Yuck
[4/13/18, 1:19:56 PM] Maitreya Naik: For state tax?
[4/13/18, 1:20:01 PM] Maitreya Naik: Let me verify
[4/13/18, 1:20:16 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: What all do we have to send them print outs of other than the tax documents? Passport scan, visa scan, I-20s...?
[4/13/18, 1:21:25 PM] Maitreya Naik: I asked Jordan Tax services. For Pittsburgh local, you only send a copy of your visa
[4/13/18, 1:21:28 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Phrasing man. Geez.
[4/13/18, 1:21:40 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Wait
[4/13/18, 1:21:44 PM] Maitreya Naik: 😉
[4/13/18, 1:22:39 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: <‎image omitted>
[4/13/18, 1:23:11 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: If *
[4/13/18, 1:23:29 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: That's without the city stuff
[4/13/18, 1:23:36 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Thank you!
[4/13/18, 1:23:51 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: And city stuff as mentioned is just the jordan tax form plus visa?
[4/13/18, 1:24:01 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: @14129616423 is that what you wanted ?
[4/13/18, 1:24:39 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Plus W2 if you worked there. Which I don't think you did. 
I also sent a copy of the photo page of my passport.
[4/13/18, 1:27:08 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Np. You just owe me $30 now. Half off of what TurboTax charged me (they also showed me what to fill in).
[4/13/18, 1:27:40 PM] Maitreya Naik: 😂
[4/13/18, 1:27:54 PM] Maitreya Naik: W2 yes
[4/13/18, 1:28:12 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Hehe thank you here you go 💸💸💸💸💸💸
[4/13/18, 1:37:45 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I wish I'd thought of that when they asked me for $60
[4/13/18, 1:48:29 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: You can try exchanging for what I gave you :D
[4/13/18, 1:48:46 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Yep! Thanks man!
[4/13/18, 1:49:13 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: 👍🏻
[4/13/18, 1:49:24 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I didn't send the Visa page but I don't give rats ass anymore. I don't owe them anyway 😛
[4/13/18, 1:49:34 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Hahah
[4/13/18, 1:49:50 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Bad(rats)ass AVK
[4/13/18, 1:50:05 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Haha 😅
[4/13/18, 2:27:06 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: While filling the Jordan tax form for local, should I tick non-resident?
[4/13/18, 2:27:16 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: And what should I do for PSD?
[4/13/18, 2:33:55 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: 880000
[4/13/18, 2:34:01 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I did
[4/13/18, 2:34:36 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: https://www.cmu.edu/oie/news-and-events/2017-2018/march/tax-student.html

Point number 5
[4/13/18, 2:35:45 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Also in the calculation for total tax liability, it asks me to multiply by                  )
[4/13/18, 2:36:09 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Oh is that multiply by 1%?
[4/13/18, 2:39:05 PM] Maitreya Naik: Yupp
[4/13/18, 2:39:10 PM] Maitreya Naik: Yupp
[4/13/18, 2:40:54 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: So i actually have to pay local tax? How do I pay them?
[4/13/18, 2:42:46 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Wait did you earn any money in PA?
[4/13/18, 2:43:35 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Oh no I didn't
[4/13/18, 2:44:16 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Well, gotta fill the form again but at least I save money :D
[4/13/18, 2:45:19 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I spent 30 USD shipping the damn thing for a 0 USD refund.
[4/13/18, 2:45:28 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Worst thing ever.
[4/13/18, 2:46:01 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: What fancy service did you use? USPS regular Postal service is like $2 or something 😛
[4/13/18, 2:46:10 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I'm confused. It says to enter my gross compensation  from the W2
[4/13/18, 2:46:27 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: And do I have to pay local tax in Connecticut?
[4/13/18, 2:46:27 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Only money earned in PA
[4/13/18, 2:46:33 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Ohh okay
[4/13/18, 2:46:39 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: UPS. It's closest to my place here.
[4/13/18, 2:46:41 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: And tracking.
[4/13/18, 2:47:26 PM] Aum Jadhav: USPS Priority Mail has tracking. $6
[4/13/18, 2:47:26 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Wow I have a feeling will get messy. I lived in one town and worked in another
[4/13/18, 2:47:41 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: But it's not close to my place.
[4/13/18, 2:47:51 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: And uber costs around 20 USD here anyway
[4/13/18, 2:47:53 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: One way
[4/13/18, 2:47:56 PM] Aum Jadhav: You should check that, you might need to pay taxes there
[4/13/18, 2:47:57 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: So I probably saved money
[4/13/18, 2:48:02 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: So for PA local tax do I send my W-2?
[4/13/18, 2:48:15 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: No
[4/13/18, 2:48:21 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Ahh okay
[4/13/18, 2:48:21 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I didn't send my VA W-2.
[4/13/18, 2:48:25 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Only PA stuff I sent.
[4/13/18, 2:48:28 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Thanks
[4/13/18, 2:48:42 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I guess someone else confirm
[4/13/18, 2:53:53 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: And what do I do about the CT local tax 😭
[4/13/18, 2:54:00 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I thought I was done
[4/13/18, 2:55:41 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Though on my w2 it says zero local tax
[4/13/18, 3:07:21 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: http://cityofshelton.org/tax-collector/

I don't think it applies to you. Plus, didn't you stay at a relative's place? 
I'd look deeper though
[4/13/18, 3:10:42 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Yep I did
[4/13/18, 3:11:08 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: And I can't find any record with my name on the sites (they have sites :0)
[4/13/18, 3:15:09 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Peace. Don't pay.
[4/13/18, 3:17:54 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Also, why don't you ask your relatives for the local tax stuff?
[4/13/18, 3:45:22 PM] Aum Jadhav: Just make sure your employer didn't withhold more than what you're liable for.
[4/13/18, 3:46:05 PM] Aum Jadhav: If it's 0 on your W2, you probably don't need to worry
[4/13/18, 4:46:51 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: As in don't need to send anything also? :D
[4/13/18, 5:11:16 PM] Maitreya Naik: You need to send in forms regardless
[4/13/18, 5:11:52 PM] Maitreya Naik: Your W-2 and payslips should give you information about how much you were taxed in each city
[4/13/18, 5:12:06 PM] Maitreya Naik: And state
[4/13/18, 9:13:40 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: 3
[4/13/18, 9:13:41 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: 2
[4/13/18, 9:13:42 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: 1
[4/13/18, 9:17:24 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: LET IT RIIIIIIIIIIPPPPPP
[4/13/18, 9:20:40 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: This is strangely hilarious
[4/13/18, 9:20:42 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZiNG31enKI&feature=youtu.be
[4/13/18, 9:38:34 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I can't wait any longer, honestly.
[4/14/18, 8:36:20 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Do you guys feel like your masters (or PhD) was worth it?
[4/14/18, 8:36:57 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Now that you're either done/almost done?
[4/14/18, 6:57:20 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Do people rent dogs? As in, to know if they can actually make time to have a pet?
[4/14/18, 6:59:27 PM] Shivam Gupta: Yeah. You can rent or ask a friend/colleague to lend your their dog for a week or so
[4/14/18, 6:59:59 PM] Shivam Gupta: *you
[4/14/18, 7:01:44 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Hmm guess friends is the way. Was wondering if there's an established service but I couldn't find anything good online
[4/14/18, 7:02:47 PM] Shivam Gupta: Don't know about a service. I'll ask a friend and let you know.
[4/14/18, 7:03:30 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: That would be great! Thanks!! 😁
[4/14/18, 7:04:28 PM] Shivam Gupta: You can also ask anyone who is going for a vacation.
[4/14/18, 7:05:48 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Yeah that's the current plan :D
Should be easy in Seattle. 🤞
[4/14/18, 7:06:01 PM] Shivam Gupta: 👌🏽
[4/14/18, 7:11:17 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: are you getting a puppppy awwww
[4/14/18, 7:11:59 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: My stupid roommates want to be convinced that we have compatible lifestyle for one
[4/14/18, 7:12:12 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I mean they are being smart about it. But yeah maybe this summer :D
[4/14/18, 7:12:17 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: pupppy
[4/14/18, 7:12:35 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: ❤️
[4/14/18, 7:12:51 PM] Shivam Gupta: Nice❤
[4/14/18, 10:24:05 PM] Maitreya Naik: I think you should try by asking to take care of a friend's dog for a week or couple of weeks. I really hope they don't have "rent" service. Poor animals being transferred from one owner to another
[4/14/18, 10:25:08 PM] Prithvi Shankar: Rescue dogs can be rented out no with an option adopt?
[4/14/18, 10:25:23 PM] Prithvi Shankar: Might increase their chances of finding a home
[4/14/18, 10:25:26 PM] Maitreya Naik: Maybe if you like a little puppy and are not sure whether you would be able to keep the little one and the pet adoption agency allows you to take it home and then if you find yourself worrying about keeping it healthy, you can return it
[4/14/18, 10:31:03 PM] Maitreya Naik: I would support a "I think I am not capable of taking good care of this one."
So there's some one who really appreciated a dog, decides to give it their possible attention and then realize if they can't take good care of it.
Rather than "oh I will take one home see if I can take care of any dog, return it after a few weeks and then think about getting a dog."
The latter one is pretty sad for the dog if it keeps getting these brief periods of different owners. It's not good for a puppy's upbringing too if they have spikes of weird owners with random diets. 
A standard diet is easily recommendable but the diligence or lack thereof of different owners would affect the puppy or dog's health. The emotional/physical tolls that different owners would put them through is also not great
[4/14/18, 10:32:45 PM] Maitreya Naik: Just think if you would be asking the same questions about adopting a child. It's an intelligent, active life that needs attention, patience, diligence, discipline, instruction, and love.
[4/14/18, 10:33:00 PM] Maitreya Naik: I would say the same about cats
[4/14/18, 10:34:19 PM] Maitreya Naik: But from what I gather, cats are less affected if they are more of the roaming types. They would be affected by the environment and the hygiene that the owner maintains then. I'm not familiar with trends in the psychology of cats
[4/14/18, 10:35:12 PM] Maitreya Naik: But I have grown up with 3 dogs and cared for 1 of them. So that's how I feel from my bias
[4/14/18, 10:35:32 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Agreed. I think it'd be pretty messed up if there was a rental service for pets.
[4/14/18, 10:35:41 PM] Maitreya Naik: And 2 more in immediate family
[4/14/18, 10:35:56 PM] Maitreya Naik: I don't see the harm of part time services like pet cafes
[4/14/18, 10:36:31 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Something equivalent to day cares for kids is fair game, rental services is messed up
[4/14/18, 10:36:57 PM] Maitreya Naik: Where the caretakers are consistent and keep a good number to provide proper attention to all animals. But I know the world isn't an ideal place and I wouldn't be surprised if pet rental agencies exist
[4/14/18, 10:39:02 PM] Maitreya Naik: That too! Yes. Not give away complete responsibility but in case you're in a company that doesn't allow pets to be taken over or for you to work from home or you don't have a possible arrangement to feed the pet while you aren't at home. Then you have a place or person or a product that allows you to feed it at certain times that you are away and get it's business done
[4/14/18, 10:42:05 PM] Maitreya Naik: I have noticed some pet owners just getting a fish to see if they can do basic care for a pet. The tank, tank filter, and cleaning etc is a cost I'm not familiar with. But I think that's a good way to start off understanding your pet care skills. Easier to monitor remotely and make a mechanism to feed them remotely too
[4/14/18, 10:43:55 PM] Maitreya Naik: Tank cleanup is less frequent than walking a dog twice or thrice every day or cleaning up after them if the poor creature has tummy issues. But that's a good way to ease into those habits than immediately off the bat
[4/14/18, 10:44:17 PM] Maitreya Naik: Probably can't tell if little fishy is sad though so that's tough
[4/14/18, 10:48:41 PM] Maitreya Naik: Definitely have a couple of friends with a dog in your closest vicinity if you're not sure about getting one. The advice and tips that they can provide you to clear some doubts that you may have that are stopping you from being sure about the capabilities is amazing. Ask them about how the weather affects them there. What are there schedules like. What do they do when they need to be away and traveling etc
[4/14/18, 10:49:32 PM] Maitreya Naik: Maybe you missed out thinking about a point and it can come up. Moreover, they can walk you through their thinking before they decided to get a dog too.
[4/14/18, 10:49:59 PM] Maitreya Naik: And that helps you become more informed and comfortable with your decision. Whether to get one or not
[4/14/18, 11:41:28 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Ooh good points dude!! 😁
Yep, will make sure we know what  we are getting into :)
[4/14/18, 11:41:40 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Thanks a lot for the suggestions! :D
[4/15/18, 12:16:57 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Are you saying puppy like Aziz Ansari does in Parks and Rec?
[4/15/18, 12:34:07 AM] Prithvi Shankar: Hahaha
[4/16/18, 9:48:30 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Need advice. I called and asked both possible towns in CT (where I lived and where I worked) and they both said I don owe them any tax and they don't even collect local tax
[4/16/18, 9:49:03 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: That's what they said when I asked how to file my return. Should I be okay not sending them anything?
[4/16/18, 9:49:28 AM] Shruti Rijhwani: Yes you should be.
[4/16/18, 9:49:28 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I haven't found anything like the Jordan tax form and they couldn't point me to anything
[4/16/18, 9:49:33 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Yayyyyy
[4/16/18, 9:49:39 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Partyyyyy
[4/16/18, 10:21:00 AM] Maitreya Naik: Yupp
[4/16/18, 10:21:25 AM] Maitreya Naik: They told you not to file ?
[4/16/18, 10:21:37 AM] Maitreya Naik: If not, call them and ask them if you need to
[4/16/18, 11:05:45 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Yeah I brought up filing even though I don't owe them and they said they don't deal with any yearly income tax stuff
[4/16/18, 2:29:27 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Do we count as Pennsylvania residents for state tax purposes?
[4/16/18, 2:31:17 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Nope
[4/16/18, 2:31:48 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: We're non residents everywhere
[4/16/18, 2:36:08 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: 😬😬 thanks
[4/16/18, 2:38:53 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: And what happens when Sprintax returns my state forms? Then I have to print sign and mail them?
[4/16/18, 4:34:48 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Yeah
[4/16/18, 4:43:50 PM] Maitreya Naik: <‎video omitted>
[4/16/18, 4:44:07 PM] Maitreya Naik: Yupp. And probably include a copy of your federal form too
[4/16/18, 5:32:12 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Well it was snowing a bit here too 😭😭
[4/16/18, 5:46:48 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Btw I finished filing state and federal today!
[4/16/18, 5:46:51 PM] Maitreya Naik: Looking for openings to internships in "data analyst" or "economic research" positions for a couple of references for the Summer. Any leads?
[4/16/18, 5:47:02 PM] Maitreya Naik: Woohoo!
[4/16/18, 5:47:09 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I feel super proud because this is not last minute for me :D :D
[4/16/18, 5:47:16 PM] Maitreya Naik: How did you get state tax forms? Sprintax?
[4/16/18, 5:47:22 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I used an online thingy called Free Tax USA
[4/16/18, 5:48:10 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I didn't want to wait for Sprintax. Try it out if you want
[4/16/18, 5:48:11 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: https://www.freetaxusa.com/
[4/16/18, 5:49:18 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: They charge about $12 per state, federal is free. And I managed to finish both state and federal together in under an hour. It was super easy to use, they e-file everything for you, and they sent me a notification that all the filings have been accepted by federal and states
[4/16/18, 5:57:43 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Hail in the morning here, woke me up, and now it's sunny af.
[4/16/18, 6:01:27 PM] Maitreya Naik: ^
[4/16/18, 6:02:47 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I might
[4/16/18, 6:03:29 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Especially for the data analyst position. Also anything in data engineering etc
[4/16/18, 6:07:13 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: I know of a business analyst role in Paris. Is that OK? 😄
[4/16/18, 6:07:32 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: These are with Walmart
[4/16/18, 6:09:52 PM] Maitreya Naik: Could be. I'll get you in touch?
[4/16/18, 6:10:02 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Great
[4/16/18, 6:10:13 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Starting date in May though
[4/16/18, 6:10:17 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Like in 2-3 weeks
[4/16/18, 6:10:22 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: or less if possible
[4/16/18, 6:10:41 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: :O
[4/16/18, 6:13:02 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: French and English are required too
[4/16/18, 6:16:25 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Also machine learning
[4/16/18, 8:13:37 PM] Akanksha Periwal CMU: Are you sure about this ?
Last I heard, we weren't eligible for e-filing.
[4/16/18, 8:13:40 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Omg Akanksha is typing
[4/16/18, 8:14:30 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: And yeah I couldn't e-file, I forgot why, and so I spent $120 on sending that shit alone.
[4/16/18, 8:14:51 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: 2 of them for refunds of 7 and 0 dollars respectively.
[4/16/18, 8:14:55 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Fun.
[4/16/18, 9:02:09 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Honestly I am not fully sure. As in for Glacier and Sprintax CMU checked them out and told us. A friend of  mine also used this and recommended it to me. I did the e filing today and apparently federal and state govts have accepted the filing, and I should get my money back soon
[4/16/18, 9:02:34 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I am going to call the tax offices tomorrow in any case and make sure things are in order
[4/16/18, 9:06:50 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I would check too, but I would not worry. You still have a day left in the worst case.
[4/16/18, 9:07:24 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Yeah :D
[4/17/18, 12:40:56 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: So I had one hour of free time
[4/17/18, 12:40:58 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: :P
[4/17/18, 12:41:32 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: <‎audio omitted>
[4/17/18, 12:41:45 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Major Throwback (salutes) anyone?
[4/17/18, 6:19:34 AM] Shruti Rijhwani: Haha nice!!!
[4/17/18, 6:20:16 AM] Shruti Rijhwani: Didn't get to the good part :(
[4/17/18, 8:03:03 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Hahaha maybe today I'll do it
[4/17/18, 8:03:34 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Or not, idk. Ideally I get someone else to sing it for me.
[4/17/18, 8:05:37 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: If a pizza's radius is defined as "z" and its depth defined "a," then what is that pizza's volume?
[4/17/18, 8:06:09 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Pizza.
[4/17/18, 8:06:22 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: 😄
[4/17/18, 8:13:48 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: This joke makes me hangry
[4/17/18, 8:13:52 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: :P
[4/17/18, 8:14:11 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It's not a joke.
[4/17/18, 8:14:16 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It's math.
[4/17/18, 8:14:31 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: You think math is a joke?
[4/17/18, 8:14:34 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Wow.
[4/17/18, 8:37:11 AM] Shivam Gupta: Hahaha awesome😂😂
[4/17/18, 8:43:57 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I love that math can be a joke as well 🤓🤓
[4/17/18, 8:48:25 AM] Maitreya Naik: Jokes only stop at your appropriateness :P
[4/17/18, 8:53:21 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Jokes about math are inappropriate 😡
[4/17/18, 8:58:59 AM] Maitreya Naik: Don't be square
[4/17/18, 8:59:13 AM] Maitreya Naik: Math jokes require an acute wit
[4/17/18, 8:59:19 AM] Shivam Gupta: Let the jokes continue I'll be around
[4/17/18, 8:59:54 AM] Shivam Gupta: You find the jokes irrational?
[4/17/18, 9:02:24 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: You on the other hand, are being obtuse. 
All of this was just a clever ruse.
You fell for the trap,
You should've just napped,
But now you're making math jokes too.
[4/17/18, 9:02:49 AM] Maitreya Naik: Maybe he thinks they are too derivative and too complex
[4/17/18, 9:05:52 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: You're trying to think of something of equal quality.
Make sure your mind doesn't stray toward triangular inequality. 
One of those jokes will always be
Less funny than two + three.
[4/17/18, 9:07:37 AM] Maitreya Naik: I would take up the suggestion to nap
I'm sitting in a class, waiting to go to a water tap
But it's futile
Not nodding my head is not my style
For that I should appreciate your mundane rap trap
[4/17/18, 9:09:20 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: You, my friend, have forgotten the math. 
Alas, you have strayed from the path. 
Not to worry, there's probably a theorem
To help you find your way back to equilibrium.
[4/17/18, 9:17:41 AM] Juan MRSD CMU: 💁‍♀
[4/17/18, 9:18:12 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: *bows*

[4/17/18, 9:41:33 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Lol thanks
[4/17/18, 9:42:23 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I'm reading the math jokes as rap it's super fun :D
[4/17/18, 9:45:02 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: https://youtu.be/X09oxyIeGuY
[4/17/18, 9:57:46 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: FYI:
Got this on my etc group. 

Quick PSA y'all, with today being Tax Day, be wary of fraudulent calls about tax forms and the IRS. They'll usually try to get you to pay some fee using iTunes gift cards (which they call "bonds" from the Apple store), but more importantly they're really aggressive on the phone. Don't be afraid to ask for their information and call them back (or hang up if they refuse), they're likely spoofing the number!
[4/17/18, 9:58:46 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I really wish I got one of these calls
[4/17/18, 9:59:10 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: get*
[4/17/18, 10:01:36 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Thanks!
[4/17/18, 10:06:10 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Guys, how do you get the refund on local taxes?
[4/17/18, 10:07:40 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: I had the same question
[4/17/18, 10:07:56 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: They'll mail you a check maybe?
[4/17/18, 10:09:11 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: So in the form you don’t have to fill the address that you lived in when you were in PA?
[4/17/18, 10:09:17 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: You fill current address
[4/17/18, 10:09:49 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: You fill in both
[4/17/18, 10:10:17 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: But there’s only one place for address
[4/17/18, 10:11:59 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: No at the top you fill your Pittsburgh addresses
[4/17/18, 10:12:05 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: Below that you fill your current address
[4/17/18, 10:14:36 AM] Maitreya Naik: I think the instructions mention the case if you stayed in Pitt or other city between January to December 2017.
And if you currently don't stay in Pittsburgh
[4/17/18, 10:28:18 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: That’s only if you moved out of Pittsburgh (or your local county) in 2017, right?
[4/17/18, 10:30:15 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: <‎image omitted>
[4/17/18, 10:31:00 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Yup, I was in Pitt for two different parts of 2017 so I put those there and in the other one I put in my current address
[4/17/18, 10:32:29 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: The other one asks for resident PSD code etc though right? I figured you'd have to put in your Pitts address there as well 🤔
[4/17/18, 10:33:27 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: One thing we can all agree on?
[4/17/18, 10:33:33 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: This form was confusing af to file.
[4/17/18, 10:36:10 AM] Gautam ECE CMU: That's a separate block :P
[4/17/18, 10:40:43 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Yeah I noticed now 😛
[4/17/18, 10:41:25 AM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: It's okay though, in my case it's all zeros anyway 😅
[4/17/18, 11:01:14 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: That’s what I thought
[4/17/18, 11:01:51 AM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: 👍🏽
[4/17/18, 5:28:34 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Apparently the IRS website crashed due to traffic and so we have an extra day to file taxes
[4/17/18, 5:29:11 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: 🙃
[4/17/18, 5:33:22 PM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: This reminds me of DL

[4/17/18, 5:38:12 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: LOL
[4/17/18, 5:38:35 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: This makes me want to recheck all the city tax stuff for VA
[4/17/18, 5:38:36 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: I don't even know when I'll get my state tax forms 😑
[4/17/18, 5:39:09 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: As in I don't think there is any city tax stuff but I should check again. Life's given me a second chance
[4/17/18, 6:00:59 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Noooo
[4/17/18, 6:01:03 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I have to get one
[4/17/18, 6:01:41 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It's so annoying. I live right next to the DMV
[4/17/18, 6:01:42 PM] Poojitha Thukral CMU: I meant deep learning not driving license🤣🤣
[4/17/18, 6:01:54 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: But I can't go get one yet coz no EAD
[4/17/18, 6:01:59 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Hahahaha

[4/17/18, 6:02:38 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I don't have a year left on my I20
[4/17/18, 6:02:44 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: So I can't apply for a DL
[4/17/18, 6:12:01 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Ohh

[4/17/18, 6:44:00 PM] Koushik Bhavani: Clearly shows how old you are :p
[4/17/18, 6:44:41 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: "She may be the song that summer sings, may be the cheer that autumn brings, maybe a hundred tearful things, within the measure of a day"
[4/17/18, 6:45:03 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Man, that's a pick up line 😄
[4/17/18, 6:46:49 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Do you, now?

Carrier? I barely know her!
[4/18/18, 9:58:49 AM] Shivam Gupta: 😂😂
[4/18/18, 10:01:13 AM] Shivam Gupta: Nice. Those step backs 👌🏽
[4/18/18, 10:12:26 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: 😂😂
[4/18/18, 2:50:55 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Update on Free Tax USA, they don't handle Form 8843, so we might have to file it ourselves. I also called up IRS yesterday and was told that systems are down so they can't confirm anything, but it should be okay if taxes have been filed. If they need more info, they will get in touch
[4/18/18, 2:52:26 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: My friend who used this got some of her money back though
[4/18/18, 2:54:39 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: How do you call the IRS
[4/18/18, 2:58:25 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/2647542-i-know-the-irs-phone-number-is-800-829-1040-but-how-to-do-you-get-someone-to-actually-answer-the-line
[4/18/18, 2:58:28 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: This worked
[4/18/18, 2:58:37 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Called them up and went through the phone tree
[4/18/18, 3:00:05 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: thank you darlin
[4/18/18, 3:00:40 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: :D
[4/18/18, 3:01:23 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Lol that question. Savage.
[4/18/18, 3:09:10 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Speaking of calling the IRS
[4/18/18, 3:10:32 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Make sure to .. make sure that your company doesn't withhold your social security and Medicare and stuff when you get H1B coz otherwise that's another headache to report. 

My friend just realized he's a citizen for tax purposes and that he hadn't had those withheld and so he had to file like 3 more things and he called the IRS and they had no idea co this was such a specific case.
[4/18/18, 3:10:54 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Coz *
[4/18/18, 3:13:57 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: wow, citizenship so fast when they want 💸💸💸
[4/18/18, 3:20:43 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: "citizenship"
[4/18/18, 6:45:16 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: https://youtu.be/cQ54GDm1eL0
[4/18/18, 6:45:51 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I mean I've seen these kinds of videos when at CMU but this was damn good :D
[4/18/18, 9:56:15 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I then saw AI being used to detect whether it was an AI generated video or a real one :P
[4/18/18, 10:15:24 PM] Maitreya Naik: Did you not see the Face 2Face from Stanford a year ago?
[4/18/18, 10:15:45 PM] Maitreya Naik: https://youtu.be/gkabNFzjQNA
[4/18/18, 10:16:32 PM] Maitreya Naik: Hahaha. What did it say? The fake background is fine but look at his eyes
[4/18/18, 10:23:16 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I didn't see it actually in use, just heard of this concept. So maybe I should have phrased my message differently
[4/18/18, 10:23:39 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: But I did think that this voice was not Obama's. They didn't seem to change the voice
[4/18/18, 10:24:05 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Not sure if I would have been able to spot that with no background info on the AI being used though
[4/19/18, 9:44:33 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: That Deadpool final trailer xD

[4/19/18, 5:12:33 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Deadpool 1 didn't disappoint in that regard :)
[4/19/18, 5:22:16 PM] Maitreya Naik: I don't like that they're showing more things in the trailer

[4/19/18, 10:09:39 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Sure some of you <cough Prithvi cough> are boring but I wouldn't _leave_ 😛
[4/19/18, 10:11:14 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Savage

I'd appreciate your opinions on this though: (uploading)
[4/21/18, 3:29:53 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: <‎audio omitted>
[4/21/18, 3:47:14 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: It's nice. A bit more electronic/metallic sounding than the original? Or have I only heard it while dancing
[4/21/18, 10:41:36 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: https://youtube.com/watch?v=lhO2s8WcS98
[4/21/18, 11:41:32 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: It's really good
[4/21/18, 11:41:51 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Thanks for listening!
[4/21/18, 11:42:27 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: It's having a funny visual illusion effect in which I am wondering if some of the text is moving even when it isn't
[4/21/18, 11:42:37 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Oh it's moving.
[4/21/18, 11:42:59 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: through the whole song?
[4/21/18, 11:43:03 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: No wonder
[4/21/18, 11:43:07 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It's a default iMovie title and the text expands. Usually it's 4 seconds long, but I stretched it for the duration of the song.
[4/21/18, 11:43:11 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I do that with all my videos.
[4/21/18, 11:43:26 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Eh but what about after that
[4/21/18, 11:43:31 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Ohh
[4/21/18, 11:43:43 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Interesting :D
[4/21/18, 11:44:05 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: You actually sat through the whole video and looked at the text?
[4/21/18, 11:44:52 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Not through the whole song because I was texting here for part of it. But it messed with my head for a bit
[4/21/18, 11:45:04 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Lol
[4/21/18, 11:52:37 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: How is everyone doing?
[4/21/18, 11:52:47 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: We should do a hangouts call soon!
[4/21/18, 11:55:35 PM] Gautam ECE CMU: Yeah let's!
[4/21/18, 11:56:24 PM] Prithvi Shankar: Yes. Probably tomorrow when est ppl are awake 😁
[4/21/18, 11:57:15 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: haha yeah
[4/22/18, 12:05:29 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Hulu vs Netflix anyone?
[4/22/18, 12:05:45 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I'm considering switching. Hulu has "It's Always Sunny"
[4/22/18, 12:05:49 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I'm only on Netflix at the moment
[4/22/18, 12:05:50 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I'm already sold.
[4/22/18, 12:06:24 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Netflix is a downer
[4/22/18, 12:06:31 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: There's nothing amazing on there, I feel
[4/22/18, 12:06:58 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Oh wait shit
[4/22/18, 12:07:00 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Netflix has Bojack
[4/22/18, 12:07:02 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: omg
[4/22/18, 12:07:11 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I've never been up to date with the latest shows or movies, so I shall withdraw from this convo :D
[4/22/18, 12:07:27 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Bye
[4/22/18, 12:07:52 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Goddammit I think I'll just have both
[4/22/18, 12:08:09 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: You could justify it as research
[4/22/18, 12:08:10 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Curse my TV show addiction
[4/22/18, 12:08:17 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Research for what
[4/22/18, 12:08:23 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I solve game engine bugs
[4/22/18, 12:08:34 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I don't make games any more, apparently
[4/22/18, 12:08:44 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: For ever? For now
[4/22/18, 12:08:45 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: ?

[4/22/18, 2:47:47 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: (Watch this on a laptop, it requires a keyboard)
[4/22/18, 2:52:48 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6KtIoeGetw
Also this. I do this all the time with typing while at work :P Embrace the inner baby driver lol
[4/22/18, 12:26:43 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Mozart people, did the management or any representatives ever just barge in?
[4/22/18, 12:27:14 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: My friend is looking for houses (please let me know if you know someone looking for a girl roommate) and she has heard some reviews
[4/22/18, 12:27:24 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Probably online reviews
[4/22/18, 12:28:01 PM] Aum Jadhav: To show the apartment? They always inform a day in advance. For maintenance they might, but we never really had much of an issue
[4/22/18, 12:28:17 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Shru is still there so I am guessing it is good
[4/22/18, 12:28:29 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Even with maintenance they only come in if you ask them to.
[4/22/18, 12:28:51 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: I'm insanely happy with Mozart and both @14129616422 and I have had no problems
[4/22/18, 12:30:06 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Yes the lease says they can come anytime they want but tbh it never happens and anyway you're at CMU most of the time so :P
[4/22/18, 12:32:03 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Haha true
[4/22/18, 12:33:24 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Thanks everyone:)
[4/22/18, 1:00:53 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Also does anyone have a Prime account I could do an order from? I want to order a gift to arrive, and for it to arrive on the correct date, I need to order it tomorrow
[4/22/18, 1:01:03 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: But my account expires today
[4/22/18, 1:03:41 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: You can use mine
[4/22/18, 1:05:34 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Thanks! Prithvi just gave me his details, so I will message you in case there is some issue :D
[4/22/18, 1:05:56 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Sure :)
[4/22/18, 1:41:54 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: https://curiosity.com/topics/this-is-how-elon-musk-can-learn-and-master-anything-quickly-curiosity?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=20180407elonlearns

I'm pretty sure most of us do at least a bit of this already, how do we get better at it ?
[4/22/18, 2:59:51 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I skimmed. I get the point, although: First half says don't think in terms of analogies. The second half says do.
[4/22/18, 3:00:24 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Lol
[4/22/18, 3:00:59 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: In any case, to answer your question: just question everything. Because you answer your own question and not simply learn answers.
[4/22/18, 3:03:33 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Even though the first part does say to go by analogy, the analogies here are "it's always been done this way" and "other people are doing it this way" so maybe that can be rephrased as going by examples
[4/22/18, 3:03:51 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: The second part says try to make an analogy between one field of knowledge and another
[4/22/18, 3:05:24 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Building on this, there is a bunch of research that's been done on having a fixed vs growth mindset. Basically do you think you're bad at something and always will be, or do you think you can try and learn almost anything and get better
[4/22/18, 3:58:56 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I just ended my Prime membership. It would have ended tomorrow anyway and I would have been autocharged for another year, but for some reason, I am getting $51 back :D
[4/22/18, 3:59:27 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Ohh because I never used any of the Prime benefits
[4/22/18, 3:59:32 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I'm such a bad millennial
[4/22/18, 4:17:38 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Aren't we all
[4/22/18, 6:10:02 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Gimme
[4/22/18, 6:10:35 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: No
[4/22/18, 6:10:48 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Pls Aditiii
[4/22/18, 6:28:57 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: Anyone here who's good with fonts?
[4/22/18, 6:29:11 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: and who'd want to help me
[4/22/18, 6:34:00 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I want to know if I am good. What's up :P
[4/22/18, 6:50:35 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: @14129614621
[4/22/18, 6:52:55 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Can confirm
[4/22/18, 7:12:42 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: In semi okay at fonts. What's up? :)
[4/22/18, 7:12:56 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: <‎image omitted>
[4/22/18, 7:13:29 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Movie sucks 😅
[4/22/18, 7:14:18 PM] Shivam Gupta: It's pretty bad
[4/22/18, 7:16:49 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: What

[4/22/18, 7:17:28 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Wait, it has John Krasinski? :o
[4/22/18, 7:17:33 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Yes!

[4/22/18, 7:18:33 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I'm hoping I'll like it despite you guys not liking it
[4/22/18, 7:18:48 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Omg there's a fantasy movie league
[4/22/18, 7:18:51 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Wtf
[4/22/18, 7:22:41 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: you liked jumanji and watched it multiple times
[4/22/18, 7:22:50 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: guess it's easy to impress you
[4/22/18, 7:22:55 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: so who knows. you might like it :P
[4/22/18, 7:23:15 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: You didn't?
[4/22/18, 7:23:36 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I disliked Game of Thrones
[4/22/18, 7:27:58 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Y u so toxic AVK
[4/22/18, 7:28:09 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I'm sitting here feeling bad about my taste when I have no reason to
[4/22/18, 7:30:24 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Y u so guilt-trippin' me Sunil
[4/22/18, 7:30:38 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I'm sitting here feeling sad about what I said when I should be working
[4/22/18, 7:31:04 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: You can't reverse guilt trip a guilt trip
[4/22/18, 7:31:09 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: That's not how it works
[4/22/18, 7:31:18 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: Dammit. Was worth a try
[4/22/18, 7:49:27 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Jumanji was awesome :D
[4/22/18, 8:11:45 PM] Maitreya Naik: I liked it. Very nice
[4/22/18, 8:11:56 PM] Maitreya Naik: #UncleResponses
[4/22/18, 9:11:06 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Same! And I'm not even an uncle!
[4/22/18, 9:11:14 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Well actually I am
[4/22/18, 9:13:49 PM] Maitreya Naik: Lol. I meant the way I said it XD
[4/22/18, 9:14:01 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Hahaha got it
[4/22/18, 9:14:08 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: But yeah, very nice indeed!
[4/22/18, 9:14:35 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I really loved how everyone crunching popcorn in the first two minutes just stopped after that hahaha
[4/22/18, 9:14:52 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I was consciously attempting to be silent.
[4/22/18, 9:14:57 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Beautifully done
[4/22/18, 9:14:59 PM] Maitreya Naik: Same
[4/22/18, 9:15:22 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: John Krasinski directed it too!
[4/22/18, 9:17:27 PM] Maitreya Naik: That's right. First attempt at directing
[4/22/18, 9:24:04 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Was the movie super scary? The concept seems interesting but I get too scared in scary movies
[4/22/18, 9:27:11 PM] Maitreya Naik: It's more of a thriller than a horror movie
[4/22/18, 9:28:19 PM] Maitreya Naik: But if you get scared easy alone, go with a friend. So you can try to distract each other with popcorn or whisperings of the attention-diversion kind
[4/22/18, 9:29:32 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: 😂 haha thanks
[4/22/18, 9:31:04 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It has a few jump scares. I mildly jumped in my seat, but idk what you would do (seeing as how I've NEVER SEEN you watch a horror movie). 
I am not going to have nightmares about it though, if that helps.
[4/22/18, 9:34:24 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I was talking to myself :) Also works.
[4/22/18, 9:35:10 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: With me, horror movies affect me more after the actual movie itself. The Conjuring 2 for instance. Wowza.
[4/22/18, 9:35:31 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Oooh apparently there's a new movie coming out that's supposed to be The Exorcist of our generation.
[4/22/18, 9:36:06 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I was thoroughly creeped out by The Exorcist and I definitely wanna watch that movie. Hopefully I make horror movie friendly friends this summer.
[4/22/18, 9:36:13 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Ain't no way I'm going to watch that alone :)
[4/22/18, 9:36:50 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Maybe they'll let me stay at their place after :)
[4/22/18, 9:38:08 PM] Maitreya Naik: Probably to possess you
[4/22/18, 9:38:46 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Rather that than deal with the inner machinations of my mind. They are an enigma which I'd rather not deal with.
[4/22/18, 9:38:53 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: 10 points to whoever gets that reference ^
[4/22/18, 9:40:43 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Please. Somebody claim the 10 points.
[4/22/18, 9:40:54 PM] Aum Jadhav: <‎GIF omitted>
[4/22/18, 9:41:04 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: MAH MAN
[4/22/18, 9:41:41 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I would have also accepted this as a response
[4/22/18, 9:41:55 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: <‎GIF omitted>
[4/22/18, 9:43:35 PM] Maitreya Naik: Yiiiiiss
[4/22/18, 9:44:02 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It's my second favourite Patrick dialogue of all time.
[4/22/18, 9:48:30 PM] Maitreya Naik: You want someone to ask the question don't you?
[4/22/18, 9:49:41 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Nope, I'm fine even if no one asks it
[4/22/18, 9:49:50 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: If I want you to know, I'll tell you
[4/22/18, 9:50:06 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Even if no one asks
[4/22/18, 9:50:47 PM] Maitreya Naik: Cools
[4/22/18, 9:51:46 PM] Maitreya Naik: I'll guess
"Being grown-up is boring. Besides I don't get jazz"
Feel like you would like it. Because part of it is true. Part of it is not but could be sarcastic
[4/22/18, 9:52:12 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Lol no, not even close.
[4/22/18, 9:52:53 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Although that's close to my third favourite
[4/22/18, 9:53:36 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71GWS3ccmvI

[4/23/18, 6:43:53 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Is this HD? And do you mind if I use this as one of my songs' background images ?
[4/23/18, 6:44:07 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: And where is that, if I may ask?
[4/23/18, 6:44:35 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: That’s the NYC skyline
[4/23/18, 6:44:42 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: No wonder
[4/23/18, 6:44:58 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: What do you suggest for a two day NYC trip?
[4/23/18, 6:45:03 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: What should I check out?
[4/23/18, 6:46:07 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: And that’s the Empire State Building (I think) all fogged up and ghostly
[4/23/18, 6:46:14 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Beautiful
[4/23/18, 6:46:23 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Shame Percy Jackson movies sucked
[4/23/18, 6:46:24 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: I have the HD image on my phone, but WhatsApp compresses it
[4/23/18, 6:46:36 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: I can email the original to you if you like
[4/23/18, 6:46:39 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Yeah that's what I was asking - do you have an hd copy
[4/23/18, 6:46:45 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Awesome, I'd love that. Thank you! :)
[4/23/18, 6:48:21 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: If it’s your first time, then Empire State Building, the WTC, Liberty Island, Madame Tussaud’s (if you haven’t seen it anywhere else), walk across the Brooklyn Bridge
[4/23/18, 6:48:32 PM] Sanjay Narayanan CMU: Those are the touristy things
[4/23/18, 6:48:35 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It is

[4/23/18, 7:54:31 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: For a second I thought that was a sustain pedal and I was about to yell at you for not appreciating it for what it is, but then I saw it's not a sustain pedal. And then I realized you'd probably never be near a sustain pedal on a normal day. And then I wrote this message. And now you're reading it.
[4/23/18, 7:55:33 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: (don't mind me, I'm waiting for dinner and bored af 🙃)
[4/23/18, 7:56:41 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: If sustain pedal is the one that comes with a piano to hold the note, I am near it all the time. 😛
[4/23/18, 7:56:59 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: I have a piano at my place. Biiggg one.
[4/23/18, 7:57:03 PM] Aditya Vamsikrishna: 😎

[4/27/18, 5:47:42 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Nicer!
[4/27/18, 5:48:18 PM] Shivam Gupta: Yeah. It started in London🙈
[4/27/18, 7:53:17 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Everyone - I have a question for you - it may sound stupid, but pliss to bear with moi. 

When you watch a music video - do you go back to it repeatedly it if it has decent visuals as well? Or do you spend most of your plays on that video with the video in the background?  (ergo, not on screen so you can't see the visuals)

I think what I'm asking is - should I mix it up? Or should I just stick to what I know best?
[4/27/18, 7:54:29 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: What do you remember about covers of songs you've seen YouTube videos of? The visuals? Or the covers themselves? Or both?
[4/27/18, 8:14:47 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: What's the biggest complaint people have about the Youtube App, @14129547000?
[4/27/18, 8:15:44 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: The app itself?
[4/27/18, 8:15:49 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: That you can't listen to music with the app in the background.
[4/27/18, 8:15:57 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Or the whole YouTube experience?
[4/27/18, 8:16:06 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Oh lol that's not the thing I was referring to though
[4/27/18, 8:16:38 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I don't care about that too much now, I buy songs and stuff.
[4/27/18, 8:16:50 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: And when I need to YouTube, I usually am on a laptop
[4/27/18, 8:16:59 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: So I can background it
[4/27/18, 8:19:53 PM] Juan MRSD CMU: But you did ask about the background visuals in an audio track, right?

[4/29/18, 5:27:08 PM] Maitreya Naik: Hard Choice
[4/29/18, 5:27:29 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I tried to watch avengers today but everything was booked out :/
[4/29/18, 5:28:34 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Tell me about it man
[4/29/18, 5:28:59 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Pity :/
[4/29/18, 5:33:52 PM] Maitreya Naik: Wow. Even in Bentonville? Thought it's a peaceful place where all dreams come true. Got tickets for a different show?
[4/29/18, 5:37:34 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Yeah, weird. The theatre I went to Friday night was only half full. But that was the 10:25 pm show though.
[4/29/18, 5:37:55 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I bet all shows there have been just that full
[4/29/18, 5:38:40 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: hehe yeah I thought it would be empty too
[4/29/18, 5:38:55 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I can't get another ticket yet because I'm on MoviePass
[4/29/18, 5:39:21 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Btw Sunil, thanks for making me get one. The terms are getting worse and worse so at least I had the good version for some time!
[4/29/18, 5:39:34 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: You still get to enjoy the old benefits
[4/29/18, 5:39:40 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Because you got one so early.
[4/29/18, 5:39:49 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: We still get 30 movies a month.
[4/29/18, 5:40:04 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: And we can watch the same movie more than once by using 'My movie isn't listed'
[4/29/18, 5:40:27 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: You're welcome.
[4/29/18, 5:41:28 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Ohhhh
[4/29/18, 5:41:33 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Thank you again
[4/29/18, 5:42:11 PM] Shruti Rijhwani: Hahahaha
[4/29/18, 5:42:40 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Movie Pass just tried to fool me today by telling me about the new terms and conditions
[4/29/18, 5:42:45 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: <‎GIF omitted>
[4/29/18, 5:54:12 PM] Maitreya Naik: Lol
[4/29/18, 5:57:12 PM] Prithvi Shankar: How to?
[4/29/18, 5:59:30 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: It should be in your theatre's list of movies it's showing
[4/29/18, 6:26:18 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Found this awesome anime on Netflix - Saiki K. Watch it. It's HILARIOUS. Just one season.
[4/29/18, 6:41:38 PM] Maitreya Naik: I've been browsing past it. Will check it out since you recommended
[4/29/18, 6:42:58 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: 👍🏻
[4/29/18, 7:02:49 PM] Maitreya Naik: "Saiki Kusuo No 'Psi' Nan" - never thought I would be the one saying this. But that's trying too hard on a pun
[4/29/18, 7:12:57 PM] Maitreya Naik: Dude. This anime is awesome 😂😂
[4/29/18, 7:13:29 PM] Maitreya Naik: If you somehow find it, watch "Daily Lives of HighSchool Boys". The most Hilarious anime you will see
[4/29/18, 8:16:56 PM] Maitreya Naik: "Read the manga for more details" 😂
[4/29/18, 8:18:54 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Hahahaha yes xD
[4/30/18, 8:29:10 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I've not gone viral :( 
But I think I'll try doing this for all my covers. And I'll definitely not make covers longer than 3 minutes. Hand animating every frame is extremely hard and I won't have enough patience.

I'd never watched this video. It's so bizzare. And so bad.
[4/30/18, 10:03:32 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: I'm very  impressed by the video
[4/30/18, 10:04:02 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Must have taken a while
[4/30/18, 10:04:27 PM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Also the song and cover
[4/30/18, 10:05:01 PM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: Thanks for the sub!

[5/1/18, 7:32:29 AM] Aditi Chalisgaonkar: Good idea :D
[5/1/18, 10:31:16 AM] Sunil Naik ETC CMU: I honestly can't believe I haven't done this yet - I'm listening to Work at work.
